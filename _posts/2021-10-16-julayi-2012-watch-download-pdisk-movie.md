  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: Julayi is essentially a change story of how an aimless younger guy, Ravi comes of age. The transformation unfolds in a thrill minute, six-music, endless fights interspersed with witty one-liners bundle. The film starts with a alternatively complex bank heist series that sets the pace for the rest of the film.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>

  <div>
    <span>Fearing a backlash, the police has Ravindra sent away to Hyderabad till they nab Bittu. He winds up in ACP Sitaram’s (Rajendra Prasad) house. That’s wherein Ravindra runs into Madhu (Ileana) and falls head-over-heels in love together with her. Just as romance starts to broaden among the two, Bittu comes lower back into the picture looking for retribution.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The narrative zips ahead at a destroy neck speed alternating between the movement sequences, own family drama, romance and comedy. It all appears slick okay, however doesn’t pretty make you pass wow or leap out of your seats in pleasure.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Allu Arjun puts in a assured overall performance as the loveable rogue. It’s a position this is proper up his alley and he consists of it off with a feature panache. He lighting up the display screen together with his dancing specifically, pulling off some pretty difficult dance movements. Ileana plays the eye candy to perfection. Sonu Sood, Rao Ramesh, Kota Srinivasa Rao, are all convincing in their characters.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The writing, mainly in first half has Trivikram Srinivas’s trademark flair written all over it. The comedy sequences involving Brahmanadam, MS Nrayana tickle your funny bones. Devi Sri Prasad’s compositions are clean at the ear and the songs have been picturised quite nicely.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The movie falls flat in the 2nd half of even though. There are some too many mistakes of common sense that seem to capture your attention as it builds in the direction of the climax, which seems to be a huge allow down. The movie has enough in it for Allu Arjun fans to dig into it, the others might not locate it as amusing.</span>
