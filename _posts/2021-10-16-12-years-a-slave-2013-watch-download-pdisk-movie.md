    <span>After &#8220;Django Unchained&#8221; and Lee Daniels&#8217; &#8220;The Butler,&#8221; both knowledgeable by way of the shameful legacy of slavery and institutionalized injustice in America, you would possibly suppose you have got glad your quota of viewing incidents of racial hatred, sexual abuse and unpleasant brutality within the past yr.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>You would be wrong. While each of these container-office and vital successes presented reimbursement for their heavy concern matter with outbreaks of humor and a hip mind-set, &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; is a somber, meditative, nearly poetic film that grants the horrors of bondage stripped down and head-on.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>For once, records is provided as personal and instant, now not a saga relying on scholarly works and court facts à l.&nbsp; A. &#8220;Amistad.&#8221; The supply is a unprecedented first-hand account based on the best-promoting nineteenth-century memoir written via Solomon Northup, a unfastened black guy from upstate New York who all of sudden had his liberty torn away after being kidnapped and sold for slave hard work in Louisiana.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>While &#8220;Django&#8221; and &#8220;The Butler&#8221; had been slaps inside the face of inequality, that is a punch to the gut. Don&#8217;t let those pastoral passages of Southern skies framed via gnarled tree limbs embellished in lacy Spanish moss fool you: they seem to exist simply as a placeholder, so that viewers can seize their breath from what they&#8217;ve just witnessed. Even Mel Gibson, whose insufferable five-minute whipping scene in &#8220;The Passion of the Christ&#8221; set the same old for such photo cinematic punishment, could be aghast if not resentful of how British director Steve McQueen guarantees that the target market palpably feels the flesh-ripping suffering of every lashing and beating on display.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Underscoring the cruelty—so commonplace that, in one worrying scene, people go approximately their day by day recurring as our hero struggles for hours dangling on his tippy-ft while trying no longer to succumb to the noose around his neck—is the aptly unsettling and once in a while discordant soundtrack with the aid of Hans Zimmer, harking back to his very own sturdy paintings on &#8220;Inception&#8221; but to plenty distinctive impact.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As in &#8220;Precious,&#8221; in which the dazzling Gabourey Sidibe kept us looking what we failed to want to see, so, too, the solemnly powerful Chiwetel Eijofor presents us with a motive for not fending off our eyes. The British level veteran born to Nigerian dad and mom first stuck the public&#8217;s attention in 2002&#8217;s &#8220;Dirty Pretty Things&#8221; and has been quietly simmering in in the main helping roles until now. One can&#8217;t believe &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; without him in the lead. His expressions as his individual is forced to sublimate his very nature so one can live on say greater than entire script&#8217;s worth of discussion.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>With 3 functions beneath his belt, McQueen has mounted his auteurship as a unflinching tackler of hard subjects with a humanistic facet: discomfort cinema, if you&#8217;ll. His debut, &#8220;Hunger,&#8221; plunged into the depths of determination and melancholy among IRA prisoners engaged within the 1981 Irish hunger strike. &#8220;Shame&#8221; uncovered the corrosive outer limits of sex addiction. For the even greater tough &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; McQueen follows Northup—whose papers are stolen and name modified to Platt, making it all the greater hard to ever confirm his unfastened status—as he is exceeded amongst plantation proprietors whose personas range from benevolent to colossal.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Nudity is definitely McQueen&#8217;s calling card. For him, bare flesh is an inventive medium, like modeling clay inside the fingers of a socially aware sculptor. His intention isn&#8217;t always to titillate but to make us feel uneasy, like unwitting voyeurs compelled to observe humankind at its maximum debased and objectified. It doesn&#8217;t take lengthy before unclothed our bodies show up onscreen in &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; as male and lady cane-discipline employees ought to wash collectively outdoor in a yard whilst the world passes by using. Later, as they sleep en masse in tight quarters, a sexual act occurs, however it&#8217;s far committed greater out of desperation for human touch than desire.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Like Lee Daniels in &#8220;The Butler,&#8221; McQueen capitalizes on his growing rep to stack the casting deck with recognizable faces, many plucked from the indie universe. Paul Giamatti lends a grubby gruffness to his all-business slave trader. Benedict Cumberbatch is Northup&#8217;s first grasp, the (comparatively) kindly William Ford, who treats Solomon and his competencies as a violinist and craftsman with appreciate while wrestling with the contradictions that their dating gives.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Paul Dano plays his nasty plantation overseer John Tibeats, who considers Northup&#8217;s every pass a personal affront, with all the hysteria he afforded his preacher in &#8220;There Will Be Blood,&#8221; plus a sadistic streak. &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; costar Bryan Batt invests his Judge Turner with effeminate affectations, while Alfre Woodard&#8217;s fancy woman slyly sips her tea at her amusement as an ex-slave who uses marriage as a passage to freedom. There is even room for &#8220;Beasts of the Southern Wild&#8221;&#8216;s Dwight Henry (as a slave) and Quvenzhané Wallis (as Northup&#8217;s daughter).</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But this supporting group all take a back seat the complex tango performed out with the aid of Northup&#8217;s most malicious master, Edwin Epps—who is given more than a few shades of gray beyond villainous black by McQueen&#8217;s favourite collaborator, Michael Fassbender—and his abused slave mistress, Patsey, brought to lifestyles with coronary heart-wrenching honesty through newcomer Lupita Nyong&#8217;o.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>You wouldn&#8217;t realize it from all the film competition raves for &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; but there are a few missteps. As Epps&#8217; shrewish wife, Sarah Paulson&#8217;s Mary might as properly be referred to as Maleficent, given her evil character&#8217;s loss of nuance. Also, a tonal misstep happens pretty early on as Northup, a devoted family man who&#8217;s first of all a piece of a dandy and full of delight, is tricked by using a pair of con artists into believing he is joining a journeying circus. After a night time of heavy ingesting, he awakens to discover himself in a darkish dungeon, shackled and on my own. It&#8217;s Edgar Allan Poe by means of manner of Walt Disney&#8217;s Pinocchio, the boy puppet coerced with the aid of hucksters into going to Pleasure Island. Nothing wrong with such fairy story allusions, however its dealing with jars.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But by the time that Brad Pitt, one of the film&#8217;s producers, arrives late in the tale with a noticeably disruptive cameo as a Canadian carpenter who offers desire to Northup that the stop to his decade-plus nightmare is nigh, most visitors might be too overwhelmed and greatly surprised to a good deal care. And as they wipe their tears and gather the electricity to go away their seats, their minds may be packed with one idea: That they have simply witnessed American slavery in all its appalling horror for the very first time.</span>
