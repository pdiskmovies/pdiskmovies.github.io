    <span>New retribution, new poison. Three old players yet another danger.&#8221; ZEE5&#8217;s highly adored web adventure Poison is back after a break in an all-new symbol. Poison 2 is a suggestive wrongdoing thrill ride of retribution and vengeance, what gets the strings from where the main season finished.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The story is misleadingly straightforward. Jaiveer is the quintessential kid nearby, who has everything going for him â€“ a caring family, faithful kinships, a consistent sweetheart and an all around outlined vocation. This, until he and his dad are embroiled in a precious stone heist and stuffed off to prison.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Jaiveer&#8217;s dad can&#8217;t take the affront and ends it all while his mom lands in unconsciousness. The family is annihilated. His better half Sara (Raai Laxmi) affirms against him in the court and he before long understands that it was the companions he had trusted, who set him up in the wreck. He promises to render retribution.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Season 2 beginnings with another face, Aditya Singh (Aftab Shivdasani) winning the stakes at a race course and leaving the &#8216;Josh&#8217; group totally shocked. Josh is possessed by Sara, alongside her sibling Oscar (Vin Rana) and spouse Harsh (Zain Iman). What plays out is a progression of exciting bends in the road in the plot, and we before long understand that Aditya and Jaiveer are a similar individual.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Then, at that point, as the situation of the past unfurl, the characters are left in a poison of retribution and the slender line among good and bad hazy spots. Now and then your feelings are with Aditya and here and there with Sara, however you can&#8217;t decide on which camp you need to fall under.</span>
