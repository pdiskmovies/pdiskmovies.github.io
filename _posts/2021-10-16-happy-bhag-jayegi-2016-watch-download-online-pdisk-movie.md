    <span>Spicy and rash, Amritsari kudi Happy (Diana Penty) escapes from her own wedding to be with her lover Guddu (Ali Fazal). This incenses her eventual lucky man &#8211; wannabe legislator Bagga (Jimmy Sheirgill). Disarray results when Happy doesn&#8217;t wind up with either and unintentionally arrives up in Pakistan. She finds Bilal (Abhay Deol), a maturing lawmaker and sparkles fly. However, he is locked in to Zoya (Momal Shiekh). Who gets the young lady?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Survey: Happy Bhag Jayegi is a new, cheerful interpretation of cross-line brotherhood that spins around a runaway lady of the hour. It draws you into tossing rationale out of the window (&#8216;baher&#8217;) for some time as it offers clean diversion with adequate gags. The waiting game between the characters, with a scramble of sentiment, shapes the story.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In case you are interested to think about our neighbors and their way of life, this film satisfies that interest somewhat. The comic trick clicks for its situational humor, keen composition and wonderful projecting. The principal half has huge loads of laugh uncontrollably minutes, transcendently coming from Piyush Mishra talking virtuous Urdu (Javed Akhtar style).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Jimmy Sheirgill may not get the young lady yet he gets vital jobs and his depiction of Bagga is the feature here. Be it him calling Ali, Justin Byeber or saying, &#8216;Simple shaadi rukwane ke peeche, padosi mulk ka haath hai&#8217;, Jimmy captures everyone&#8217;s attention, undoubtedly. Both Abhay and Ali are similarly skilled. The perfect Diana Penty, establishes a connection as the fiery Punjaban Happy, her person radically not quite the same as the one she depicted in Cocktail and sparkles all through. Momal is earnest.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Since the adoration tracks appear to be unconvincing and unexpected, the subsequent half tanks a little. The childish climactic pursue succession also appears to be adolescent. In any case, generally speaking, the family parody figures out how to make the right things happen and change the present (if not the historical backdrop) of Indo-Pak relations for the two hours that it endures. Lock in and partake in the ride, Janaab!</span>
