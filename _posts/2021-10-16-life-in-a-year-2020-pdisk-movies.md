    <span>I don&#8217;t put stock in happy endings,&#8221; Cara Delevingne yells at Jaden Smith in this gushing, sobfest cancer romance. She plays Izzy, a Pittsburgh teenager diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer and given not exactly a year to live. Izzy is a character you may perceive from different movies: the beautiful cancer-patient sweetheart. Her work here is to be life-affirmingly brave and then, at that point bite the dust (tastefully), accordingly enriching her sweetheart Daryn (Smith) with a tragic yet alluring backstory.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Which is a shame, because Delevingne gives a great performance; not convincing exactly, yet likable and charismatic. And to be fair, Izzy is a paper-thin character – on paper, she probably resembled an assortment of banalities. Izzy experiences childhood with some unacceptable part of town, raised from the age of six by the babysitter after her medication addict mum walked out. She&#8217;s tattooed and intense outwardly, with blue hair, and a sweet-natured and courageous soul.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Smith, then again, is a tad bland as rich child Daryn, an outstanding understudy being prepared for greatness by his dad (Cuba Gooding Jr). Covertly, Daryn dreams of becoming a rapper; and here&#8217;s the place where Izzy proves to be handy with her grab-life-while-you-can dying-young lady intelligence. The pair meet when the two of them gatecrash a rap gig. Izzy nicknames Daryn &#8220;Square&#8221;. The blue hair ends up being a hairpiece: she lost her hair during chemo. At the point when he finds out she&#8217;s dying, Daryn chooses to cram a lifetime of achievements into their brief year together. The upbeat montages of the two seizing the day and the slo-mo panic dashes to A&E feel like scenes rearranged from twelve terminal-sickness weepies. Depressingly, Izzy appears to have absolutely no companions or dreams of her own.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Nothing here is real-world or complicated – however there a few prominent attempts: in one scene, Smith wears a pair of elastic gloves to wash a bedpan. It&#8217;s a fairytale high on teenage narcissism: parents are either absent or eventually lowered by their savvy hearted offspring. In any case, as these movies always do, it gets you in the end with a left snare to the tear pipes. I was genuinely seething at being manipulated by such mawkish baloney.</span>
