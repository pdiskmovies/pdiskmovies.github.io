  <span>The Gist: The space explorer is Emma Green (Hilary Swank), who is the leader of Atlas 1, the main monitored mission to Mars. She and her group have arrived on a lunar base that is set up to be the dispatch site for the rocket to Mars, and the whole mission will require 3 years. This is all that Emma has been working for, however her psyche is somewhere else.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>We find in flashback to half a month prior to the mission dispatch. Emma is appreciating existence with her significant other Matt Logan (Josh Charles) and adolescent little girl Alexis (Talitha Bateman). Matt was scheduled to go to Mars however NASA grounded him when Alexis was a child since he has a hereditary clinical issue that could cause sores on his mind. So Emma was placed responsible for the mission, and her experience as a Navy pilot and a space explorer shows that she is an extraordinary decision.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Not every person on her global group is so certain, particularly the more experienced Russian cosmonaut Misha (Mark Ivanir) and Lu (Vivian Wu), a physicist from China. Kwesi (Ato Essandoh), a British botanist going on his first mission, and Ram (Ray Panthaki), an Iranian pilot, appear to trust her. While, during their pre-dispatch public interview, a correspondent raises that enduring the mission is 50-50, Emma recoils yet replies as sincerely as possible.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>During the trip to the moon, an episode happens that further sows Misha and Lu&#8217;s question of Emma. At the point when they&#8217;re met by Darlene Cole (Gabrielle Rose), the overseer of the mission, both of them give clashing tales about their job in suppressing the synthetic hole and where they thought Emma fizzled in her work. Darlene&#8217;s chief, George Lane (Brian Markinson), needs Emma supplanted by her reinforcement, the officer of the lunar base, yet Darlene demands that Emma can in any case do the work.</span>
