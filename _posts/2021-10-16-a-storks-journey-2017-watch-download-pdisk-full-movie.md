  <span>Parents need to realize that A Stork&#8217;s Journey is an enjoyable story about a youthful bird desperate to track down his adopted family as they migrate south for the colder time of year. Abandonment is a critical component of the tale, and there are several sad moments. The leading character is orphaned early in the film. Expect lots of cartoon action and suspense as the movie&#8217;s likable, idiosyncratic characters experience a profusion of dangerous enemies (furious nectar badgers, bats, spiders, a bear) and fly into scary situations (storms, a rockslide, an airplane, steep falls). In numerous scenes, apparently one of the gallant team may not survive; each lies still, lifeless, until eventually the individual is resuscitated. This English-language adaptation of an European animated film finds the migrating birds while heading to Africa rather than the Southern U.S., Mexico, and South America, the destinations of North American birds. It&#8217;s just for kids who can clearly distinguish real versus imagine savagery.</span>
