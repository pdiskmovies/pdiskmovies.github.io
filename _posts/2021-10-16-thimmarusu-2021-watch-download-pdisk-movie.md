    <span>Review: Telugu films are again in theatres once more. And first up is Satadev&#8217;s Thimmarusu. A remake of Kannada mystery Birbal Trilogy Case 1: Finding Vajramuni, this investigative crime drama stays in large part genuine to the authentic and impresses in parts. While there&#8217;s suspense and intrigue as the film progresses, a contrived screenplay makes it frustrating at instances.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Aravind, a cab driver and a police informer is killed in a grotesque murder. Vasu (Ankith), a younger pub worker reveals the body of the cab driving force even as returning home from work and at once alerts the police. To inspect the scene, police officer Bhupati Raju (Ajay) walks in and with the assist of lawyer Varaha Murthy (Ravi Babu), frames Vasu for the murder. When Vasu comes out on parole after spending 8 years in prison, Ram Chandra (Satya Dev), an upcoming attorney, makes a decision to take in his case. How he investigates the murder at the same time as handling this situation and attempts to unearth real perpetrator forms the crux of the story.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The director, Sharan Koppisetty, tries to construct intrigue and suspense and there are a few part-of-the seat moments. Apart from a few minor modifications, the director sticks to the unique script and the film in large part works. The c programming language bang is one of the first-rate scenes in the movie as it maintains the target market hooked and sets you up well for the second one half of. So is the pre-climax screen that shows Ram Chandra&#8217;s proper connection to the case.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The investigative elements of the movie, however, are half-baked and unrealistic. The loss of tempo in the screenplay is a deterrent and the manner a number of it is proven is exceedingly exaggerated. There is an try to simplifying the entirety to the target audience via declaring the obvious at instances, which makes it a tedious watch. The climax, too, is vulnerable and hurried. There&#8217;s a love track in there, with Priyanka Jawalkar which felt out of vicinity and almost inappropriate. Satyadev even though has proven his versatility as an actor yet again and grants a stable performance. Ankith, who played the innocent younger man is the stand-out performer inside the film and does a incredible process.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>At the middle of it, Thimmarusu is an earnest attempt and thrills in most parts, but is otherwise permit down via a contrived screenplay and a hurried climax.</span>
