    <span>The film, which depends on Ismat Chugtai&#8217;s acclaimed novella &#8216;Lihaaf&#8217;, relates the genuine occasions in her day to day existence when she was in her adolescents, just as pieces from her grown-up life paving the way to the purpose in her being blamed for profanity in her writing relating to her early stages.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Audit: &#8216;Lihaaf: The Quilt&#8217; shifts back and forth between two equal tracks; one portraying Ismat Chugtai&#8217;s (Tannishtha Chatterjee) court procedures in Lahore subsequent to being accused of profanity for composing &#8216;Lihaaf&#8217;, and the other is a performance of the short story itself.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In the initial scenes, Ismat gets a court summons from Lahore, and we are immediately brought into her everyday battles and artistic aspirations. During the court meetings, she is joined by her significant other Shahid (Rahat Kazmi) and author cum-companion Manto (Shoib Nikash Shah). Alongside the meeting, she portrays the genuine occurrences, most of which are described by youthful Ismat (Anushka Sen), particularly during her break stay with the riddle, Begum Jaan (Sonal Sehgal). What follows is the youngster&#8217;s record of her time there — including her perplexity over Begum Jaan and her masseuse Rabbo&#8217;s (Namita Lal) kinship, her shock at seeing the blanket (utilized by Begum) take confusing shapes around evening time, for the most part taking after the &#8216;glaring issue at hand&#8217; and her fear when Begum asks her, &#8220;The number of ribs does one have?&#8221; and afterward proceeds to find.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Chief Rahat Kazmi co-composed the content with Sonal Sehgal, adjusting the story in its most profound quintessence and introducing an exceptionally obstinate and furious female figure who will go to any length to be heard. While &#8216;Lihaaf&#8217; remains consistent with the source material—adding perfectly planned allegories and Urdu shayari&#8217;s (verse) to the story—it misses the mark regarding making up for the shortcoming left by an insane screenplay. Regardless of its imperfections, the three-sided universe of Begum Jaan, Rabbo, and a youthful Ismat is undeniably more convincing than Chatterjee&#8217;s adult Ismat, who lives in a court without struggle.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Tannistha&#8217;s able shoulders bear the weight of telling the previous occasions, and she even tries really hard to pass on the person&#8217;s blazing soul, yet the conflictingly composed exchanges upset the stream, making it difficult to sympathize with the person. Indeed, even the court dramatization moves at a painfully slow speed, nearly overwhelming the power of Chugtai&#8217;s story, which is told in an equal track.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Sonal Sehgal&#8217;s depiction of a shattered sovereign who is a genuine repository for love and human touch is persuading. The two entertainers—Sonal as Begum and Namita as her masseuse Rabboo—appear to be quiet in the baffling haveli. It&#8217;s just when they need to cooperate that their anxiety becomes evident, featuring the absence of science between the primary characters. For example, in a scene where Begum peruses the section from an erotica to Rabbo, their signals seem abnormal and out of sync, as well, making it hard for them to act and for the crowd to observe what was at show. By and large, it disparages the affection that emerged from anguishing want.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Anushka Sen is amazing as youthful Ismat. She inspires a scope of feelings &#8211; from fun loving investigation of the Begum&#8217;s castle to inconvenience at the Begum&#8217;s nearness to her. In spite of assuming an indispensable part in the plot that speeds up the development of the equivalent sex relationship, Mir Sarwar&#8217;s Nawab Sahib barely establishes a connection.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Basically, &#8216;Lihaaf: The Quilt&#8217; would have been exceptional off without the court dramatization, which just adds to the film&#8217;s extra-long runtime. All things considered, the variation has its minutes, making it a normal watch.</span>
