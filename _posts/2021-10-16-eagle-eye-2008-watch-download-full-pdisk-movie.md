<div>
  <div>
    <span>I&#8217;m not exactly sold on Shia.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Reputed to be Hollywood&#8217;s next &#8220;It&#8221; fellow, Shia LaBeouf has had a progression of high profile films including the fourth portion of &#8220;Indiana Jones,&#8221; &#8220;Transformers,&#8221; &#8220;Surf&#8217;s Up&#8221; and the unexpected hit &#8220;Disturbia.&#8221;&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In any case, we should likewise recollect that LaBeouf has additionally given us such clunkers as &#8220;The Battle of Shaker Heights,&#8221; &#8220;Constantine&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie&#8217;s Angels: Full Throttle.&#8221;&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It all kind of levels out.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>LaBeouf is positively a promising youthful entertainer, however &#8220;Eagle Eye&#8221; is a clear advance in reverse for both he and co-star Michelle Monaghan (&#8220;Made of Honor,&#8221; &#8220;The Heartbreak Kid&#8221;).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>To some degree suggestive of the also silly and advertised up &#8220;Wrench,&#8221; &#8220;Eagle Eye&#8221; is outrageous to such an extent that one might have to go to &#8220;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&#8221; to get a portion of the real world. The fundamental reason of &#8220;Eagle Eye&#8221; affects two individuals united by an underhanded &#8220;voice&#8221; who apparently has control of innovation worldwide and will unleash devastation except if they do his offering.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>This is the third film in succession for LaBeouf where innovation appeared to issue more than acting, and it&#8217;s turning out to be progressively hard to discern whether LaBeouf is going to satisfy his guarantee or not. While I may expect this kind of film from any semblance of a Jason Statham, it&#8217;s frustrating from a well, entertainer can, all things considered, act.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Chief D.J. Caruso, who worked with LaBeouf on &#8220;Disturbia,&#8221; keeps the activity streaming relentless, a modest and simple trick like to please devotees of careless, superfluous activity cushion. &#8220;Eagle Eye&#8221; has sufficient techno chatter to seem, by all accounts, to be a science fiction type flick, however most who really comprehend the hypotheses behind sci-fi are probably going to moan with weariness here.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The straightforward truth is that the story behind &#8220;Eagle Eye&#8221; has neither rhyme nor reason, the characters are paper meager and, might I venture to say it, even the activity is inadequately altered regardless of being basically relentless. Unfortunately, not at all like the considerably more dreadful &#8220;Wrench,&#8221; I was unable to try and chuckle here. I was downright exhausted.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>&#8220;Eagle Eye&#8221; isn&#8217;t a film for individuals who can wind down their minds, it&#8217;s a film for individuals whose cerebrums have been forever quieted. Assuming you view that to be an affront, so be it.</span>
