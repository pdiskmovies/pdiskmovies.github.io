    <span>Rodney Ascher&#8217;s motion pictures harp on absurd theories until they start to make a strange kind of sense. His provocative feature-length debut &#8220;Room 237&#8221; mashed up a range of wild theories about the meaning of &#8220;The Shining&#8221; (Kubrick admitting he faked the moon landing, obviously) and his terrifying &#8220;The Nightmare&#8221; finds casualties of rest paralysis musing on whether they&#8217;ve had bonafide supernatural experiences. Presently comes &#8220;A Glitch in the Matrix,&#8221; a meandering however imaginative riff on same scary-fun approach to actualizing outrageous ideas — yet this one broadens the extension. The summary of voices in &#8220;A Glitch in the Matrix&#8221; assert with such certainty that the world doesn&#8217;t exist that even doubters may think about it.&nbsp;</span>

        The purported &#8220;simulation theory&#8221; has floated around in various structures for millennia, however became more articulated after the achievement &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; encouraged many watchers to scrutinize the reality of their surroundings. Drawing on interviews with 10 specialists and internet theorists with an endearing mashup of film cuts and trippy 3-D animation, &#8220;A Glitch in the Matrix&#8221; adapts to the internal rationale of its reverberation chamber until starts to sound pretty convincing according to its own preferences. In case you&#8217;re not already one of the diehards convinced we&#8217;re living in a simulation, this film may actually get you there.&nbsp;

        <span>While Ascher casts a wide net, &#8220;A Glitch in the Matrix&#8221; functions admirably as an outline of the various epistemological inquiries it raises. The musings of Ascher&#8217;s subjects range from Descartes and Neo to Philip K. Dick and Elon Musk, as they map out the advancement of the simulation theory and how it became a particularly vast wellspring of speculation. A portion of Ascher&#8217;s subjects sound like they&#8217;ve spent an excessively long time digging through message boards and YouTube nut cases, however Ascher is the ultimate recorder of the &#8220;very online&#8221; impact. His rambling assemblage of voices zig and zag, for certain observations more engrossing than others, yet they create the aggregate impression of how a single outrageous assertion can gain traction through the quantity of voices who back it up.&nbsp;</span>

        <span>A few voices have a remarkable megaphone. Ascher constructs his foundation around fascinating archival material from a 1977 talk conveyed by Phillip K. Dick, five years before his death, where he made the unequivocal assertion that &#8220;We are living in a PC simulated reality&#8221; as a disbelieving group looked on. Certainly, Dick&#8217;s rationale turned on inexplicable flashbacks to non-existent recollections probably set off by the sodium pentathol he got for a new dental medical procedure, yet the foreknowledge of his science fiction books — from &#8220;The Man in the High Castle&#8221; to &#8220;A Scanner Darkly&#8221; — loan barely sufficient authority to these claims for current aficionados to take the baton and run. These include Musk, who repeatedly asserrs that &#8220;the argue for the simulation is very impressive.&#8221; No one should go to an unconventional billionaire savage for existential insights, however Ascher allows his subjects to have fun batting it around.</span>
