  <span>Hindi films discover a new hero this time. He&#8217;s the naxalite who first kills the corrupt state marketers and then ends up killing for the state. Now it really is pretty a formidable step for Bobby Deol who comes to a decision to don a special position as Chamku, the favourite lieutenant of a Pushkin-reading Danny Denzongpa who talks of sophistication battle and revolution from his mystery adda in the dense jungles.</span>

<div>
  <div>
    <span>The movie begins on a promising note with a few resourceful frames shooting the action as Bobby goes approximately his business with deadpan glee. But midway, you recognise the Naxalbari was only a handy ploy to bundle the same antique formulation of an action hero who is out to avenge the dying of his father. Chamku become honestly a happy village boy who saw his father being shot by way of the neighborhood thakur and will by no means rest happy ever after. Not even if he finds the chiffon-clad college madam (Priyanka Chopra) who sings Yippie-Yippie, every time she sees him. Strangely, she never is aware of what her brooding beau genuinely does, despite the fact that he maintains disappearing for covert missions for his new boss (Irrfan Khan).</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The trouble with Chamku is its disjointed script and its relentless flashbacks which mar a film that could have tread new floor. Although, we do laud the attempts of the Deol Inc to show to severe cinema.</span>
