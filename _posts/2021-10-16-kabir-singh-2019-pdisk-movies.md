  * <span face="arial, sans-serif">Kabir, a genius yet hostile medical student, falls in love with Preeti from his college. When Preeti&#8217;s father spots the couple kissing, he opposes their relationship and decides to marry her off.</span>

<span>Kabir Singh film cast: Shahid Kapoor, Kiara Advani, Soham Majumdar, Arjan Bajwa, Kamini Kaushal, Suresh Oberoi&nbsp;</span>

<span>Kabir Singh film chief: Sandeep Vanga Reddy&nbsp;</span>

<span>Kabir Singh film rating: One and a half stars&nbsp;</span>

<span>To watch a person like Kabir Singh do this thing for almost three hours plonks the watcher solidly in a position of contention. Here&#8217;s a that carrying on with individual life hollering and yelling, grunting and-drinking at work, alleviating his seething charisma with vile certainty, fundamentally being a chauvinist this and that, is something worthy.&nbsp;</span>

<span>So for what reason do we continue to watch, despite the fact that such a great deal what Kabir does is so hostile, so dangerous, and makes us anxious? We do this since we are persuaded that he has something more to him. We desire to see that something else, the something that will allow us to see past the revolting dividers he&#8217;s worked for himself. What makes us human.</span>
