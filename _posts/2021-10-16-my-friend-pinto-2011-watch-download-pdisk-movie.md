    <span>Life loses its meaning for Pinto, a Goan priest inside the making, whilst his most effective soul mate, his mom, passes away. Time for him to take a wreck from Goa and pass to Mumbai searching for his lengthy lost (other) soul mate &#8212; his first-rate friend, Sameer. Only later to understand the maximum metropolis has became Sameer into Sam. Will he get his pal returned? And will that be a cakewalk?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: Pinto (Prateik Babbar) is from Goa. And the ways of Mumbai are unknown to him. First, he is out assembly his lengthy lost friend, Sameer, after a prolonged gap, hoping the latter continues to be the identical, however in vain. Second he tries saving a avenue canine for a bunch of street kids ending up losing his wallet. Third, Vada Pao is some thing definitely alien to his flavor buds (and popping eyes). Now does this simply make you snigger?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Enter the sub plots. First a don who wishes his boss killed. Second the Big Boss (Makrand Deshpande) who wishes a pup to gift his Mona darling. Third is a brand new pal who wins most effective while he shall we his coronary heart take over his thoughts in the game of having a bet (now it is a lesson free of charge given by way of Pinto). Fourth, the Don&#8217;s mole (Divya Dutta) who gets drunk when she smells her husband&#8217;s infidelity. Now does this hold you questioning what lies subsequent?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>So what&#8217;s it that truly tickles the humorous bone in right here? Definitely no longer Pinto&#8217;s slow and steady steps. Not even his favourite one liner at some stage in his journey: `Momma said&#8230;&#8217; Or for that depend the silly antics of a don and his group caught by an obese kid who can&#8217;t recover from his burger. The most effective respite comes whilst Pinto meets Maggie (Kalki Koechlin). Unfortunately though, even Kalki can&#8217;t do an awful lot for lack of screen time &#8212; in totality some 20 mins. As for Divya Dutta and Makrand Deshpande whipping every other after a couple of at the rocks just isn&#8217;t always proper. Finally, it is returned to Pinto who&#8217;s taken it on him to make the world an excellent place to live in. Of path, all the goodness seems lost in too many subplots&#8230;.</span>
