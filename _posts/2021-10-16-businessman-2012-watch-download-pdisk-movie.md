    <span>A movie like “Businessman” is a cause for birthday celebration, absolutely because it does away with pressured comedian interjections within the narrative. For once, the comedy in a mainstream Telugu flick is all situational without being slapstick. The humor is dry and loaded with sarcasm, taking pot shots on everything beneath the sun, however does the process although evoking peals of laughter. Kudos to director Puri Jagannath for developing with the ones lines.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>And then there is Mahesh Babu, in full waft at that. “Round off chesi confuse cheyalanukuntunnara. Confusion lo inka ekkuva kottestha&#8230; ” is going a punch speak. “Matladaniki vacchanu kabatti, manasaupurthy ga kottatledu&#8230;” goes every other. As some distance humor goes it is virtually a step up. Some could say that the punch dialogues in “Businessman” are even better, wackier and quirkier than “Pokiri”. The should haves of a Mahesh Babu pot-boiler are dutifully ticked off, as an alternative properly at that. Five minutes into the film, you get the sensation you&#8217;ll experience this one, and the feeling stays on till the give up.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Coming to the story, there isn’t any. Mahesh plays Surya Bhai, who moves to Mumbai with a unmarried factor schedule — that of turning into the undisputed don of the commercial enterprise capital’s underworld. It takes place to be a time whilst Mumbai is taking part in a surprisingly crime-unfastened phase with all of the mafia kingpins being nabbed, a whole lot to the glee of Nassar, the commissioner of Police.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>His happiness proves to be short lived as Surya starts offevolved to recruit all the goons in the city. He calls his gang Surya Exports and Imports. He soon starts to cut deals with all and sundry — small time businessmen to the biggest politicians, even the Prime Minister. He corporatizes the complete business of mafia and regularly grows to grow to be a rule unto himself. He has a little flashback too that&#8217;s found out closer to the stop.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Chitra (Kajal Aggarwal) is the daughter of the Police Commissioner. She additionally happens to be Surya’s love interest. The much-hyped lip-lock additionally turns out satisfactory.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>“Businessman” is an ordinary Puri Jagannath film loaded with mindset and style. The narrative movements alongside at a breakneck pace hardly supplying you with time to catch your breath. The movement is gritty and sensible with out going overboard. The main lady, Kajal performs the attention-candy to perfection, albeit now not having the ‘Ileana’ kind of impact in “Pokiri”. Guess you can&#8217;t assist but compare this one to the 2006 blockbuster, for this is the primary time Puri and Mahesh have come collectively considering the fact that “Pokiri”.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As far as the performances pass, Mahesh takes the cake. He had the writer- backed role however, nevertheless enlivens the complete movie with an severe performance. The climax scene is specifically rivetting as Mahesh switches from anger to comedy effects. This should be one among his first-class performances if no longer the first-class. Mahesh actually carries the movie from the begin to the give up. The supporting cast along with Sayaji Shinde, Prakash Raj and Subba Raju do justice to their roles. Music through Thaman is ideal and the background score sticks out, amplifying the enjoy. The movie rankings excessive on production values and visible imagery.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>All in all, it’s an unpretentious entertainer that manages to strike the proper balance. It might not be a cinematic marvel but sure has enough in it to keep you fascinated till the stop. How a whole lot you like the movie would possibly just be a remember of the way fond you are of Mahesh Babu.</span>
