  A exact vicinity isn’t really worth a lot inside the Spanish heist movie “The Vault,” that is generally set in or round Madrid’s historical Bank of Spain building. The film from director Jaume Balagueró isn&#8217;t always the first recent caper to characteristic the Bank of Spain—there’s also the ongoing Netflix collection “Money Heist,” which debuted in 2017—and that’s sort of the hassle: the makers of “The Vault” don’t appear to understand how to reveal off the Bank of Spain, or any of their film’s different probably attractive functions.
</div>

<div>
  “The Vault” is therefore a paint-by way of-numbers caper about a crew of hard-working newbie financial institution robbers, who, beneath the leadership of blue collar salvage expert Walter (Liam Cunningham), chase after a chest of seventeenth century gold coins. (Walter initially recovered this bounty from the lowest of a Spanish shipwreck, but his booty was soon taken via the Spanish government.) Most of the plot is exactly formulaic: Walter and his fellow team individuals scheme over constructing plans and laptop video display units, improvise and double-pass every different whenever suitable, and are often chased through Gustavo (Jose Coronado), an ill-tempered ex-army safety officer. You’ve probably seen movies like “The Vault” earlier than, most effective set in another country, and offering lots less exposition.
</div>

<div>
  Then once more, a familiarity with movies like “The Vault” might be why you may watch it within the first region. Most of its characters are described not handiest with the aid of their roles in Walter’s group, however additionally the tics and quirks which have come to outline those roles in a selection of different heist movies, a few better than others. If you’re wondering in case you’ll like this movie, check its dramatis personae, beginning with “the mastermind,” as one character calls him: Thom (Freddie Highmore), a excellent-intelligent and exceedingly admired engineering pupil.
</div>

<div>
  Like most splendid-smart technology kinds, Thom is an idealist who loves a project. He’s given one by Walter, who’s already assembled a motley crew of heist movie clichés. There’s hothead guy of action James (Sam Riley), cocky laptop hacker Klaus (Axel Stein), jaded pickpocket Lorraine (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey), and flamboyant “acquisitions” expert Simon (Luis Tosar). Walter’s group in most cases gathers information and executes Thom’s plan to interrupt into the Bank of Spain’s vault, that is covered by Gustavo and a complicated security device that, once caused, floods the bank’s basement.
</div>

<div>
  The financial institution’s Spanish putting should count number extra when you consider that that’s ostensibly what sets “The Vault” apart from the other bastard kids of the lately rebooted “Ocean’s Eleven” heist films (Thom even likens Walter to Danny Ocean). After all, Walter has timed his group’s heist in order that it coincides with Spain’s soccer suits throughout the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Unfortunately, the simplest uniquely Spanish things approximately “The Vault” are Simon’s infrequent quips about Gustavo and his employers’ “very Spanish” conduct. Gustavo is otherwise a inventory man or woman, a Javert-like antagonist who can’t let pass of the mind-set or the training he picked up when he led an anti-terrorism challenge pressure.
</div>

<div>
  To be fair: you probably shouldn’t expect an awful lot from a film whose protagonists all speak and act like they’re refugees from higher style films. Walter and his team pow-wow in “the war room” and say things like “the safety system is now our b***h.” They also use pre-recorded video pictures to trick the Bank of Spain’s guards, and over-provide an explanation for any part of their plan that’s even vaguely technical, presumably for effortlessly distracted and/or burdened visitors. And whilst Walter’s human beings do their element, Gustavo squints off-digital camera at a financial institution of glowing TV video display units and wonders about the thieves’ activities. There’s some light ticking clock suspense and a few double-crosses, too. None of it’s enough to make “The Vault” extra or less of what it is.
</div>

<div>
  “The Vault” additionally makes a speciality of plot points and man or woman reasons we’ve both already seen before or certainly don’t need to peer once more. There’s lots of debate that, at the floor, exhibits the characters’ reasons, but in reality, all you need to understand is: Walter’s teammates all have egos and are ordinarily chummy due to the fact, uh, teamwork?
</div>

<div>
  Thom’s an ideal example of this form of dim Xerox replica dramaturgy: he accepts Walter’s proposition due to the fact the Bank of Spain’s security gadget poses a terrific technical undertaking and Walter seems to be an honorable thief. Thom’s time-honored fine guy person is also confirmed whilst he comes to a decision that he must be a part of Lorraine and James when they break into the Bank of Spain’s vault. The logic at the back of this choice is easy sufficient to be genre movie quick-hand: Thom wouldn’t ask every person to do some thing that he wasn’t organized to do himself.
</div>

<div>
  These are all first-class declarations of rationale, but they take too much time, and feel like so much needless padding among already gradual and visually flat set pieces. “The Vault” isn&#8217;t, in other words, simply derivative—it’s additionally flabby and bland. While the Bank of Spain may be a super putting for a heist, there’s nothing in “The Vault” to indicate that the financial institution (or something in it) is thrilling sufficient to atone for uninspired storytelling.
