<div>
  <span>Pandian, the son of a cop and a wannabe rowdy, falls in love with Kadambarai, a hearing-impaired female, who desires him to tackle Killivalavan, a gangster-flesh presser who has murdered her parents.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Right inside the commencing scene of Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, director Vignesh Shivan makes it clean what we&#8217;re in for — a unusual — and at instances darkly funny — comedy. We see a younger boy, Pandian, sitting internal a jail cellular, and just when we suppose that he&#8217;s a juvenile prisoner, we&#8217;re shown that he&#8217;s absolutely the son of the station&#8217;s inspector, Meenakumari. He moves up a verbal exchange with a small-time gangster (Naan Kadavul Rajendran, who receives a humorous scene afterward, which entails a pistol which makes a &#8216;meow&#8217; sound when it goes off) inside the mobile, and this conjures up him s a good deal that he makes a decision that he wants to emerge as simplest a rowdy and now not a police officer.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The boy grows up right into a younger guy (Vijay Sethupathy) who behaves like a rowdy (his den is painted with fluorescent paint where the costs of diverse jobs (from slicing off one&#8217;s hand to cross calling are graffitied), despite the fact that the best tussles that he is requested to mediate is among schoolboys. And the story he had heard from the prisoner within the cellular impacts his existence yet again. A character from the tale, Kadambari walks into his lifestyles. She is a listening to-impaired girl whose cop father, who had long past after Killivalavan (Parthiban), the gangster-baby-kisser liable for his wife&#8217;s demise, is lacking and she requests him to tune him down. Pandian is smitten via the girl and decides to help her. Things come to a stage whilst Kadambari tells him that she can live with him only if he can defeat the gangster who took away the humans close to her.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The plot may stumble upon as a critical revenge drama, but Vignesh Shivan shows a lightness of contact in the course of that makes the film so much fun. And, he maintains things breezy even if situations get extreme. There is constantly a funny one-liner or a bouncy musical cue waiting to make us relax, and the comical and emotional beats of the film are introduced collectively seamlessly in an admirable way. He is aided in this undertaking by way of his track director Anirudh&#8217;s rollicking score (and songs, which, for a exchange, aren&#8217;t toilet breaks but add to the temper of the scenes), cinematographer George C Williams&#8217; appropriate frames and editor Sreekar Prasad&#8217;s cuts which preserve even the extreme scenes fleet-footed. The segment in which Pandian and his buddies attempt to kidnap Killivalavan is most of the hilarious moments we have seen in Tamil cinema this 12 months. The plan, as we assume, goes gloriously incorrect, but is comedic gold.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The director also provides a bit of novelty to the storyline via showing us sure scenes and then going back to them at a later level to give us a entire photograph. Early on, Kadambari is brought into the police station whilst she is observed wandering on my own at night and picking up a combat with the cop. And while Vignesh indicates us what had surely occurred, things fall into vicinity with an ease that is to be seen to trust.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>There are more than one moments in which the movie threatens to descend into melodrama. One occurs whilst Kadambari gets information of her father&#8217;s dying and mourns for him. This scene is going longer than vital and is shot in a self-aware fashion (a close-up of Pandian and Kadambari&#8217;s lips) that most effective yanks us out of the film. The other takes region inside the midst of a shoot-out when we are told something has befallen Pandian&#8217;s mother. We get a pay-off to this scene at some point of the closing credit but it most effective comes across as indulgent.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The actors are extremely good. There is not one of the mannered performance that we saw in Vijay Sethupathy in movies like Orange Mittai. Instead, he appears comfortable and that allows turn the man or woman into a charmer. Parthiban has some crackling scenes and the actor manages to make Killivalavan comical and menacing on the identical time. This is one of the sturdy performances of Nayanthara; possibly, dubbing for herself has in reality helped. And her disability is refreshingly dealt with in a matter-of-reality way (there may be no solo violin wailing within the heritage to make us empathise along with her) and the movie has amusing gambling around her impairment (the scene wherein she is abducted by using Anandraj, who play a small-time rowdy, is hilarious). RJ Balaji increases a smile on occasion with his pop cultural references. He even makes use of the display character of yesteryear villains Anandraj and Mansoor Ali Khan to feature humour to the scenes. The best person who receives lost is Radikaa, with a person that remains offscreen after the initial scenes. Maybe, that is why the director selected to have the ultimate credits scene.</span>
