  <span>Put accountable for a female VIP&#8217;s dead body, a youthful mortuary chaperon gloats to his companions who demand in seeing the dead lady exposed, and things just become more bent as one of the companions communicates an interest in necrophilia in this autonomous thrill ride from Spain. From such a plot portrayal alone, &#8216;El Cadáver de Anna Fritz&#8217; may seem like a movie done in staggeringly awful taste, however it is seldom shady (hands down the briefest looks at the bare corpse are seen) and an abrupt contort following eighteen minutes pulls the movie a quite unique way with the companions compelled to settle on some intense good choices. None of the entertainers playing the three companions are especially exceptional, yet there are some intriguing movements with regards to character; most prominently, the funeral home orderly goes from hesitantly giving his companions access, terrified of losing his employment, to energetically pulling reasonable tricks on them. All things considered, Bernat Samuell has a bit of a dull person &#8211; he is basically the ethical compass of the gathering all through, however co-stars Christian Valencia and Albert Carbó go through enough changes in character to keep things new. The plot likewise requires some willingness to accept some far-fetched situations (medicinally talking specifically) yet it is a drawing in film completely in the event that one doesn&#8217;t contemplate the likelihood of it to an extreme. A few thoughts raised by the film are intriguing, including superstar love and the capacity of the human endurance intuition to surpass judiciousness. Checking in at just barely longer than an hour long as well, the film is energetically paced and never overstays its gladly received.</span>
