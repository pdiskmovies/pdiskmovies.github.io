    <span>Two of Hallmark&#8217;s most wonderful stars conflict over a modest community candy shoppe in the fall sentiment &#8216;Sweet Autumn&#8217; (debuting Oct. 17 as a component of The Hallmark Channel&#8217;s Fall Harvest).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In short: Aunt Dee parts her treats shop between her niece Maggie (Nikki DeLoach) and maple rancher Dex (Andrew Walker). Following letters Dee left, the two reveal the justification behind her choice, during the Sweet Autumn celebration.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Through practically the main a large portion of, there&#8217;s really not a ton going on with &#8216;Sweet Autumn.&#8217; Maggie and Dex aren&#8217;t actually characterized characters &#8211; beside the way that Maggie needs to develop Aunt Dee&#8217;s treats shop while Dex would prefer to keep the shop an unassuming community stowed away confidential. Their conflicting pioneering desires to the side, neither one of the characters has a great deal of characterized character. They&#8217;re both pleasant, yet beautiful boring characters.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>This by itself wouldn&#8217;t be the most noticeably awful blemish on the planet &#8211; on the grounds that the continually enchanting DeLoach and Walker by and by bring their A-game &#8211; yet &#8216;Sweet&#8217; has a major story issue. The film opens with Maggie and her colleague under the gun to make nothing to joke about &#8230; then, at that point that plot just somewhat drops off the guide. Dex has some slim b-plot fixated on his maple syrup packaging diversion. This plot for the most part vanishes until the plot starts to slows down.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The most fascinating part of &#8216;Sweet&#8217; is the distinction among Maggie and Dex&#8217;s thoughts for Aunt Dee&#8217;s shop &#8211; yet the film doesn&#8217;t sort through Maggie&#8217;s thoughts for extension or Dex&#8217;s hesitance for development. &#8220;We should have more areas!&#8221; &#8220;We should have one area.&#8221; That&#8217;s with regards to it. &#8216;Sweet&#8217; shouldn&#8217;t be all out business fighting &#8211; yet discovering more prominent contrast among Maggie and Dex&#8217;s yearnings for the candy shoppe can just make their unavoidable sentiment all the sweeter.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Gracious, then, at that point there&#8217;s Aunt Dee&#8217;s letters. This is a strange plot driver that is totally superfluous. She&#8217;s referenced enough all through the film to as of now feel like a supporting person who just has a couple of moments of screentime &#8211; the film doesn&#8217;t likewise require her letters to help the crowd to remember the effect she needed to Maggie and Dex.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>To the film&#8217;s credit, &#8216;Sweet&#8217; is an ideal autumnal pleasure. Set in the charming orange and red toned unassuming community, between the roughage rides, maple syrup taffy and fall celebration, this Hallmark flick energetically accepts the fall season.</span>
