        Survey: Early on in the show, a dirt stash, that is the storyteller (voiceover by Shivankit Singh Parihar) of the story clarifies – &#8220;Gullak isn&#8217;t a story yet a progression of accounts.&#8221; True to its promise, the series unfurls through shifting occasions in the existence of the Mishras. There&#8217;s the worshiping and snide mother Shanti (Geetanjali Kulkarni) who seldom talks without shouting. Her charming and excusing spouse Santosh (Jameel Khan) who works at the neighborhood power division. Their senior child Annu (Vaibhav Raj Gupta), who is stressed over the family&#8217;s future, is planning for Staff Selection Commission (SSC) tests and his joyful more youthful sibling Aman (Harsh Mayar) is his sidekick.&nbsp;

        Coordinated by Amrit Raj Gupta, &#8216;Gullak&#8217; (A stash of recollections) is a charming five-scene web series brought to you by TVF. The show is relatable and through its straightforward account, it demonstrates that this is the narrative of any working class Indian family. With no groundbreaking occasions, the Mishras grapple with uproarious clothes washers, fights between the kinfolks, objections about the nourishment (for example, Shanti prepares &#8216;Tehri&#8217; for lunch, notwithstanding, all relatives consider it a &#8216;frustrating yellow aloo chawal&#8217;) and neighborhood aunts (particularly Bittu&#8217;s mother played by Sunita Rajwar).&nbsp;

        On account of Nikhil Vijay Motghare&#8217;s straightforward composition, the series&#8217; humor isn&#8217;t roar with laughter. Notwithstanding, it figures out how to keep a satisfying tone generally speaking. The discoursed and the scenery continue reminding the watchers that it&#8217;s about the standard existence of normal individuals. Likewise, the foundation score by Anurag Saikia works out positively for the story and the title track is hummable, as well.&nbsp;

        Moreover, this dramatization is bound with pitch-ideal exhibitions by gifted Jameel Khan and a fabulous Geetanjali Kulkarni, who wrongly articulated not many words effortlessly—like invertor as inbertor. Her exchange conveyance and articulations are remarkable. The enthusiastic Vaibhav Raj Gupta and Harsh Mayar resemble some other kin – they can&#8217;t stand one another and scan&#8217;t live without each other too. It is ideal to be around these four characters and see them bond and fight together.&nbsp;
