  <div>
    <span>English youngster thrill ride series The A List, right now streaming on Netflix, focuses on a gathering of teenagers who attended day camp on the isolated Peregrine Island, yet the series isn&#8217;t all about fun games where the characters lounge around campfires roasting marshmallows and recounting amusing apparition stories. Rather, it&#8217;s far from it.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>What starts off as a normal camp involvement in icebreakers and playing capture the flag transforms into a frightening involvement as a top priority control, a hypochondriac non-human camper, and all contact with the rest of the world snapped from their fingertips.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In season one, the main character Mia (Lisa Ambalavanar) begins immediately off kilter with individual camper, Amber (Ellie Duckles). At the outset, Mia is the sovereign honey bee of the camp, yet Amber rapidly takes her thunder. Amber steals each and every companion Mia makes and manipulates them to deduction they were her companions, not Mia&#8217;s, through some sort of brain control. Through the course of the series, Amber herself turns into a secret—for what reason does she have powers? For what reason does she manipulate over half of the campers? For what reason did everybody at camp get cut off from the real world? The secrets continued developing and developing.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Season two answers some satisfying inquiries.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The second season of The A List, released June 26, follows the aftermath of the campers breaking away from Amber&#8217;s instant-popularity mind control and the reappearance of the evidently dead camper, Midge (Indianna Ryan).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Midge and Amber have some association in the show and, at times, are believed to be the same individual: the spirit of Midge in Amber (regardless of the two being separate characters). This season asks, what character is the greater wickedness: Midge or Amber? At the outset, Midge seemed like the timid, nonthreatening outcast, however soon the tables are turned and Midge appears really threatening, controlling, and unfeeling.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Then again, Amber turns out to be a greater amount of an ally and starts to feel feelings. I appreciated not really realizing who might be the greater villain all through the series because it kept me as eager and anxious as ever. Should Amber currently be trusted or will she stab the characters in the back as she did in season one? It also fills in as an intriguing reclamation arc, because Amber, clearly not human, starts to feel human feelings as the series nears an end because of her weakening force.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>While the show answers the topic of who&#8217;s the greater evil by the end—although it&#8217;s anything but simple—other aspects of the show kept me pondering.</span>
