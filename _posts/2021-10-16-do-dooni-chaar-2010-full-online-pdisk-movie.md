    <span>Duggal has gotten an annual duty discount of a couple thousand rupees as, there&#8217;s energy in the family as every one has an alternate interpretation of how the cash ought to be spent. In any case, all plans are settled when Duggal&#8217;s sister, Urmi (Supriya Shukla), phones to welcome the family to a marriage in her parents in law&#8217;s family. The sister requests that Santosh Duggal accompany his family in a vehicle as opposed to the bike they have as the vehicle would make her parents in law treat her with more regard.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Since he can&#8217;t manage the cost of a vehicle, Kusum drives him to acquire the neighbor, Farooqui&#8217;s (Akhilendra Mishra) vehicle. The neighbor hesitantly gives them his vehicle for going to Meerut to go to the wedding. While the vehicle ends up being an extravagant suggestion for the Duggals, it, all things considered, makes the parents in law of the sister treat them (Duggals) and her with undeniably more regard. In any case, Payal bangs the vehicle similarly as she is leaving it outside the proprietor&#8217;s home on their re-visitation of Delhi. A battle results between Duggal, the vehicle proprietor and his significant other who spits toxin. That is when Duggal, embarrassed as he feels, chooses to purchase a vehicle for his family, under any conditions.</span>
