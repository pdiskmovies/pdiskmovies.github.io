    <span>Damien Macé and Alex Wajsbrot, who&#8217;s past work in the movie industry basically consists of enhanced visualizations, make their directorial debut with the movie Don&#8217;t Hang Up.

        The two primary stars Garrett Clayton and Gregg Sulkin, are best known for their work on Disney Channel&#8217;s Teen Beach Movie and Wizards of Waverly Place respectively. Although the characters that Clayton and Sulkin play appear to be like the attractive, famous folks they normally play, the circumstances the characters face don&#8217;t relate with their typical jobs, making their exhibitions something crowds haven&#8217;t seen from them. Clayton and Sulkin show that they can deal with the dim material this film conveys, giving greater versatility to them and go against the stereotype of being uneven actors. With that being said, the actors are still youthful and up and coming, who have never worked with dismay, and didn&#8217;t have the greatest material to work with in this film, but they both did their jobs justice, with Sulkin having the better exhibition of the two.&nbsp;

        <span>Don&#8217;t Hang Up plainly draws impact from numerous more established and current frightfulness works of art including but not limited to, &#8220;When A Stranger Calls&#8221; and &#8220;Saw.&#8221; Due to this, and its utilization of natural tropes, the primary plot points are effectively predictable but the little details that lead up to them are not too self-evident or exhausting.&nbsp;</span>

        <span>The vigilante of the film, Mr. Lee, has an exceptionally sinister voice, and presence that sends shudders down the spine. Don&#8217;t Hang Up takes for some time to set everything up but eventually discovers its footing and has a great speed the rest of the way through.&nbsp;</span>

        <span>The couple of expectations I had for the movie were not extremely high, so it was pretty simple for the film to outperform them, but I still accept that this is a film worthy of your review. Don&#8217;t Hang Up is in no way, shape or form a film that the majority will applaud, but it certainly is an excellent feat for a film that has many cast and team individuals that are not simply new to the frightfulness sort, but for some of them, fledglings in their calling overall. In the event that you allow Don&#8217;t Hang Up an opportunity, you will find that at its center, it&#8217;s another pleasant teen slasher flick. Don&#8217;t hang Up is currently accessible to stream on Amazon Prime.</span>
