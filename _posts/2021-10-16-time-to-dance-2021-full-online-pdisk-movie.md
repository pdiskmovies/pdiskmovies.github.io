    <span>Audit: &#8216;Time To Dance&#8217; is about a dance rivalry in London which each dancer longs for winning. The two, untouched most loved entertainers William with his expert dancer Isha are soon to take an interest in the test. However, Isha harms her leg which drives William bidding farewell to her.

    <span>Stanley Menino D&#8217;Costa&#8217;s directorial debut follows the strides of numerous other dance films (ABCD, Street Dancer, and so forth) Yet, what makes it distinctive is that it highlights assorted dance structures—dance hall and Latin dances—in the core of the story. Movement by Stanley and Remo D-Souza, particularly the last execution is hypnotizing. Composed by Deepak Dwivedi, this film has a regular storyline where the man shows up to save the young lady and does everything to win her heart and the rest becomes history. The screenplay is particularly unsurprising all along. Regardless of being a film that is genuinely founded on dance its music disillusions deeply, with the exception of the mashup of two heartfelt tunes &#8216;Mein Agar Kahoon&#8217; and &#8216;Bol Do Na Zara&#8217;.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Debutante Isabelle Kaif is great and her onscreen presence will help you to remember her sister (Katrina Kaif). Her dance stances are simply awesome, notwithstanding, she actually needs to chip away at her usual range of familiarity before the camera. Sooraj Pancholi makes an honest effort to place in a genuine execution. His science with Isabelle is enchanting and together they looked very viable, particularly in their shows. Other than the focal characters, Rajpal Yadav as Rishabh&#8217;s companion and colleague, Sada and Waluscha De Sousa as Isha&#8217;s senior sister, Meher helps in pushing the story forward.&nbsp;</span>
