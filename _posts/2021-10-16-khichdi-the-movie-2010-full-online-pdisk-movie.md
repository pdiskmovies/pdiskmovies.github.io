    <span>The Parekh family is an odd combination of moronic and more idiotic individuals. Presently, that is a serious aggravation for Babuji (Anang Desai), the patriarch of the family who turns out to be in a minority in the midst of the simple-minded individuals like child, Prafulla (Rajeev Mehta), girl in-law, Hansa (Supriya Pathak) and her sibling, Himanshu (Jamnadas Majethia).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Disarray wins as the family attempts to track down a reasonable counterpart for Himanshu and zeroes down on the Punjabi young lady living nearby. Will it be joyfully ever-after for the blundering Singh and Parekh parivaar?&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: The dolts are legends, indeed. The famous sitcom from TV takes on a celluloid symbol as Khichdi: The Movie, attempting to reproduce the blockhead box humor of the group of morons, where idiocy is the standard and insight, an exemption.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Does the producer succeed? It isn&#8217;t not difficult to make an interpretation of a TV satire into a movie, however chief Aatish Kapadia figures out how to rise above the majority of the hiccups. At any rate, he doesn&#8217;t have the cast tirelessly posturing for family pictures in a solitary camera shot. Yet, the trial of a satire lies in its capacity to make the watchers giggle. Khichdi doesn&#8217;t finish this assessment with no problem at all. While Supriya Pathak and Rajeev Mehta do figure out how to stimulate the clever bone with their savvy ineptitude (they are so glad for it!) and their clever jokes, the content neglects to support the humor. Obviously, there are sure arrangements that make them smile from one ear to another, similar to the Parekhs let free in a hospital&#8230;. In any case, you do wish they weren&#8217;t not many and far between.</span>
