  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The reason is devilishly basic: 456 down-on-their-karma individuals burdened with huge obligations are offered a chance to partake in a game. They do as such willingly, with no thought that what they have pursued is a progression of jungle gym games with destructive turns.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>

He opens the satchel to uncover wads of money and two collapsed paper tiles. The game is designated &#8220;ddakji&#8221; and the point is to attempt to flip over your adversary&#8217;s paper tile (the &#8220;ddakji&#8221;).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The stake is 100,000 won (US$84) and Gi-hun acknowledges, however when he loses and can&#8217;t pay, the man takes his installment by slapping him. Gi-hun loses over and over, getting a new smack on the cheek each time. In the long run, he succeeds and gets two 50,000 won bills.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The man gives him a card with a circle, triangle and square on it and proposes he get back to the number on the assuming he needs to play a game for some genuine cash. After Gi-hun calls, he&#8217;s gotten on a traffic intersection by a van driven by a concealed man in pink overalls, and he blacks out.</span>
