    <span>Albeit the family professes to be affectionate before the world, there&#8217;s a great deal of strain between the individuals. Rebecca and Jenny disdain Margaret in light of the fact that their philosophies don&#8217;t coordinate. Peter had, years prior, surrendered the material life and had passed on the family to battle for itself. In a bid to raise her family, Rebecca, subsequently, kisses up to the passes made by her chief, Kanhaiyalal Deshmukh (Vinay Apte), whom she continues to call by the truncated name of KLD, and Malkani (Vivek Vaswani), a rich financial specialist, only so she can give an agreeable lifestyle to her family.</span>
