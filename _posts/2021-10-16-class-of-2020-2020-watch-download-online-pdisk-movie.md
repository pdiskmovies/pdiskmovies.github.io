    <span>The story follows 8 high school students and their fantasies, failures and love hate relationships. The boys; Hardik, Raunak, Toto and Ibrahim and the girls; Ranchi, Alia, Priyanka and Zoya combat peer pressure on one hand and cope with parental expectations on the other. They simultaneously overcoming their fears and internal squabbles as Class of 2020 progresses.&nbsp;</span><span>De Nobili High School, an ultra modern elite school is where all the action takes place. Here, kissing is usual in the school bus and dating is the most talked about subject in class rooms.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In addition, parents, guardians and teachers have their own expectations from students resulting in conflicts and controversies.&nbsp;</span><span>The second season (first season was Class of 2017) runs through 11 episodes of 20 minutes each encompassing all the fiasco that takes place albeit with a silver lining. The series highlights the perils of over expectations and wrath of peer pressure which creates havoc in lives of adolescent students.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Top honours invariably should go to Alam Khan as Tanmay Badwa aka Toto. He makes a strong impact with his different kind of hair do and peculiar facial expressions. Next among the girls, Joyita Chatterjee as Ranchi Das Gupta excels as her character.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Chetna Pandey as Priyanka Aluwalia, a strict class leader who gets torn between a haunting past and a daunting present does a good job. Additionally, Isha Chawlaa as Aalia, a confused girl who is unable to make the right choices is also brilliant.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Furthermore, Sushant Tanwar as Hardik looks handsome and performs well along with Rohan Mehra as a brazen and flirtatious Ibrahim. Mazhar Khan as a devil may care hunk Ronit and Nibedita Pal as beautiful Zoey Dsouza also add the much needed glamour to Class of 2020.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The story of Vikas Gupta and his screen play along with Ruhee Bagga is interesting and the way they present the most relevant issues faced by adolescents and teenagers in a modern society against the backdrop of love, friendship, infatuation and sex is really remarkable.&nbsp;</span><span>Aarambh M Singh’s direction in transferring Gupta’s concept on to the screen is outstanding. Moreover, the casting is perfect and the actors are an asset to this series.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>There are not many negatives to point out. Depicting high school as a hot bed for dating, sex and other vices is something which is hard to digest yet true.&nbsp;</span><span>The party episodes, however, feel a bit dragged and should have been handled in a better way to avoid monotony.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Don’t get misguided and treat this as another adult high school comedy. Keeping aside some eccentric sequences, Class of 2020 focuses on some sensitive issues faced by teenagers. Also watch it for the young cast who are not going to disappoint with their flawless performances.</span>
