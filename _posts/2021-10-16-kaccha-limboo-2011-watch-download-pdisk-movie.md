    <span>Movie Review: When the credit start to roll, you spot director Sagar Ballary announcing thank you to Gulzar for Kitaab and Francois Truffaut for 400 Blows. Naturally then, the paramount question is: Does Kaccha Limboo stay up to its notion?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film starts offevolved at the proper be aware because it traces the dysfunctional international of oddball Shambhu who just cannot match in&#8230;Neither in school, wherein he will become the butt of jokes due to his ungainly frame photo (he is obese, untidy, refuses to put on footwear, sports shorts as opposed to trousers) nor at domestic in which he just can not seem to connect to his over-effusive step daddy (Atul Kulkarni) and pregnant mother (Sarika). In a telling scene which sums up his isolation, the self-immersed Shambhu asks `Tara, who?&#8217; while his dad tells him to pipe down the tune due to the fact his little one sis, Tara is snoozing.</span>

  <div>
    <span>The film is replete with such exciting little info which make it a promising viewing. But abruptly, the movie changes track and Shambhu&#8217;s misadventures at domestic and school are changed by his encounters with a bunch of slum children in Mumbai&#8217;s underworld. Whatever occurred to the cracker-like and punctiliously explosive situations wherein the teen was fumbling with a youngster overwhelm and trying his fine to in shape in with the snooty coterie in class. Shambhu&#8217;s extended encounters with Vitthal, the bustee youngster derail the plot and go away you fidgety and bored.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Sad, due to the fact Kaccha Limboo should sincerely had been a wonderful comeback from the director who gave cutting-edge cinema one in every of its smartest comedies: Bheja Fry. Nevertheless, watch out for the performances via the children and via Sarika and Atul Kulkarni as the confused-out dad and mom. Why cannot we&#8217;ve more of Sarika, please?</span>
