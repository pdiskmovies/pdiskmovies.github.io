    <span>Movie Review: Based at the headline-grabbing case of Kannada actor Maria Susairaj, her boyfriend Jerome Matthew and the murdered television govt Neeraj Grover, Not A Love Story is a startling film. Startling, because it captures the nasty, brutal side of reputedly everyday and first-rate folks who on occasion, see nothing amiss within the maximum heinous of crimes. The casualness with which Anusha and Robin try and cowl the tracks of their crime, dispose off the frame of the victim, make love even while he lies useless and bloodied within the next room fills you with sit back and dread.</span>

    <span>And it really is in which Ram Gopal Varma manages to score a point. Artistically, this may not be his nice film. But in phrases of capturing the darkish recesses of the human psyche, Varma scripts a chilling experience. Not once are the perpetrators engulfed with a experience of guilt or regret, nor do they even remotely worry retribution. All they need to do is keep on with the enterprise of life as if nothing has came about.</span>

    <span>Of course, the movie ends&nbsp; and leaves you with a sense of incompleteness, however whilst it lasts, it holds your hobby. Both Mahie Gill and Deepak Dobriyal imbue their roles with a hint of realism and remain recognisable, normal small towners. Varma&#8217;s digicam angles are zany like usually and his historical past tune creates a language of its own.</span>

    <span>Gory, yes but Not A Love Story is an interesting look at of the darker and more devious spots of friendly neighbourhood types.</span>
