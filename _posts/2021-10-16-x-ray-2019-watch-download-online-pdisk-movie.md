    <span>Sparkles fly when a young man named Vishal (Rahul Sharma) chances upon a specific Miss Yashi (Yashika Kapoor). Will this experience transform into something delightful or is the appearance of this lady end up being a terrible experience for the team?&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Audit: One critical evening, Vishal chooses to drop his arrangements with the family and stay at home rather to partake in some solitary time. Before long, he is upset by an outsider – Yashi – who looks for help after her vehicle stalls close to his cabin. While trying to help the more interesting, he was immediately stricken by, Vishal welcomes her to remain over at his place and in a matter of moments, expresses his adoration for the delightful young lady. The circumstance twistings crazy when Yashi rejects his proposition and Vishal takes to forceful intends to prevail upon her for the evening. What occurs next between these two outsiders, in a forlorn home, on a confine road, frames the crux of this spine chiller.&nbsp;</span>

Also, concerning the acting bit, both (debutant) Rahul Sharma and Yashika Kapoor have given true exhibitions in this wrongdoing spine chiller.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The cinematography is fair in parts, yet the scenes where it centers around the lady are pointlessly vulgar and difficult to endure. Likewise, the extensive plotline forces the chief to rehash a portion of the scenes and arrangements, making it a monotonous watch.</span>
