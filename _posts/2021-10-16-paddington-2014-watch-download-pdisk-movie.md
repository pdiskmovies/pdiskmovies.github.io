    <span>It’s been extra than 50 years seeing that a little bear from darkest Peru located himself homeless and on my own on Paddington station sporting a tag announcing “Please appearance after this endure. Thank you”, earlier than being followed via the Brown circle of relatives. In that time Paddington Bear has obtained ursine countrywide treasure reputation in the UK and is similarly loved abroad: Michael Bond’s 26 Paddington books have bought extra than 35m copies international and have been translated into forty languages. And this weekend sees the discharge of the first Paddington function film, which stars Hugh Bonneville, Nicole Kidman, Sally Hawkins, Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters, with Ben Whishaw offering the voice of the bear. An accompanying Paddington “path” around London features 50 small statues of the undergo decorated by celebrities ranging from David Beckham and Benedict Cumberbatch to Boris Johnson. The statues can be auctioned for charity on the give up of December.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>“Paddington’s very actual to me,” says Bond, whilst we meet within the observe of the London domestic in Little Venice he stocks with his spouse of 33 years, Sue. It’s packed with mementos of the man or woman for whom the 88-12 months-antique creator has spent more than half of his life growing adventures. “I think it’s something bears have. So he comes round with me in spirit and I think an awful lot of tales start due to the fact you spot a sign or you pay attention some communication and you watched ‘what if?’.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Those “what ifs” have led not handiest to the books but also fifty six episodes of the 1970s BBC lively films, a level play, image books, annuals, a strip caricature, a cookery e-book, a guide to London and, of route, vending. Piles and piles of it, enough to fill dedicated “Paddington and Friends” shops and a concession at Selfridges. And Paddington toys are anticipated to be back on children’s Christmas lists this 12 months with the brand new film. Bond himself was baffled at a number of the requests that came to him within the early days of Paddington-mania – “Toilet rolls with a image of Paddington! That was an smooth one to say no to.” The first Paddington licensee, who produced the classic tender toys dressed in duffel coats, hats and little Dunlop wellies, turned into clothier Shirley Clarkson, who made the first actual Paddington Bear as a Christmas gift for her young son (and future Top Gear presenter) Jeremy.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It’s an amazing degree of achievement for a British kids’s book character who doesn’t play quidditch – one matched best perhaps through that other endearingly bumbling bear, Pooh. So to what does Bond attribute the exceptional affection his introduction conjures up? “Paddington is without end positive and continually comes lower back for extra, irrespective of how typically his hopes are dashed,” says Bond. For him, it’s absolutely the pleasure of a little undergo who&#8217;s an intruder moving into scrapes and mishaps – continually with the high-quality of intentions – and popping out on top on every occasion. Add that timeless attraction to adventures which might be cutting-edge (the ultimate ebook, Paddington Races Ahead turned into pegged to the 2012 London Olympics) and Bond makes the factor that even though the man or woman has stayed exactly the same, the arena has changed and the tales pass with the times. The different aspect approximately Paddington, he adds, “is that he stands up for matters, he’s no longer terrified of going immediately to the pinnacle and giving them a hard stare”.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Studio Canal and the British Board of Film Classification narrowly overlooked feeling the overall pressure of a hard stare after Paddington was offered a PG certificates instead of the U that could be extra ordinary for a youngsters’s movie of this type, because of “moderate terrible language” and “mild innuendo”. Bond, who had but to see the film when the score was confirmed, became reportedly dismayed at the chance of sex and swearing, declaring that he might be very disillusioned and “may not sleep properly”. Fortunately, a muffled “bloody” and the sight of Downton Abbey’s Hugh Bonneville pass-dressing as a charlady become the quantity of the depravity, and a relieved Bond declared the movie “a pleasure from start to complete”.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The movie succeeds in shooting the humour and spirit of the original Paddington and also a number of the pathos as he arrives in a cold, moist London wherein “rarely all of us wears a hat or says hi there”, and he yearns to find a domestic. Director Paul King weaves in some of London’s other immigration stories – filling the soundtrack is the calypso song of the Windrush arrivals who had been settling in Notting Hill across the time that Bond was first writing his stories – and concludes with usual Paddington optimism: “In London nobody’s alike, which means everyone fits in.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In 1958, whilst he turned into writing the primary e book, A Bear Called Paddington, Bond changed into in part stimulated by means of recollections of the evacuee youngsters he saw skip thru Reading station from London: “They all had a label spherical their neck with their name and address on and a touch case or bundle containing all their treasured possessions. So Paddington, in a sense, changed into a refugee, and I do think that there’s no sadder sight than refugees.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The books also feature Paddington’s fine buddy, Mr Gruber, a Notting Hill antique dealer and Hungarian refugee, who can empathise with Paddington as a fellow “outsider”. Bond primarily based the man or woman on his agent, Harvey Unna, who had escaped Germany just earlier than the struggle – “He become about to were made the youngest decide in Germany whilst somebody despatched him a message telling him to get out of the country speedy, they’d visible his call on a listing. So he arrived with approximately £10 in his pocket”.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Bond changed into born in 1926 in Newbury in Berkshire. His father, a “mild sort of person”, turned into a supervisor running for the put up office and a stickler for policies. However, Bond sees some thing of him in Paddington: “My father changed into a very well mannered man and he always wore a hat. We’d cross on holiday to the Isle of Wight and he used to head inside the sea together with his trousers rolled up and preserve his hat on in case he met someone he knew and would have something to raise. He would have been mortified if he hadn’t.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It turned into a happy youth domestic. “I suppose the most valuable factor you could give a toddler is your time,” Bond says. “And I suppose the following most precious thing you can supply a baby is an hobby in books. If you’re introduced up with books being a part of the furnishings, with a tale being study to you while you go to mattress at night, it’s a superb begin in existence. I by no means went to bed without a story once I changed into small.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>However, Bond’s college years were much less idyllic. His C of E mother and father, who by no means went to church, despatched him to a strict, price-paying Catholic school, Presentation College, run by Catholic brothers who carried rubber straps for disciplining the lads. The faculty turned into chosen “for the easy cause my mother favored the coloration of the blazer. She didn’t make many mistakes in lifestyles but that become one of them,” says Bond. He describes being “knocked approximately the top” by one specially vicious master and biking an extended route to highschool to keep away from getting beaten up by boys from the neighborhood state college, who could lie in wait.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As a result, even though his mother and father would have favored him to go to university, Bond fled training at 14 and commenced work as a mail boy in a nearby legal professional’s workplace, earning 10 shillings every week. But by the age of 15 he turned into operating for the BBC. It had set up a small transmitter in Reading and took him on as a “youth in schooling”, based on his childhood hobby in building amplifiers and radio units. A couple of years later, having narrowly escaped demise when 4 bombs were dropped from a German aircraft directly to the station, blowing the lowest of the building away, he volunteered for the airforce. His wartime stories gave him the cloth and the self belief to jot down, along with a typewriter within the orderly room of his barracks in Egypt, and there he completed his first quick story, which changed into everyday by way of the London Opinion. The mag paid him seven guineas and left him thinking that he “wouldn’t mind being a writer”.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Bond continued to write short tales for magazines after returning to the BBC at the stop of the conflict. He went first to the monitoring carrier in Caversham Park, which turned into complete of overseas nationals listening to overseas broadcasts, so “there were an lousy lot of exciting people – all of them had a tale to inform”, and then became a cameraman, ultimately running on Blue Peter.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As the achievement of Paddington grew, Bond become pressured to select among his&nbsp; careers and, in 1965, he gave up television to jot down complete-time. He swiftly got here up with the idea of The Herbs – a youngsters’s display presenting Parsley the Lion and Dill the Dog – and partnered with the animation agency FilmFair to write the scripts for that series, which the BBC commissioned to replace Bill and Ben, observed through The Adventures of Parsley. He became working with stop-motion director/manufacturer Ivor Wood, who had made The Magic Roundabout, and who turned into keen to try animating Paddington.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The TV Paddington’s extraordinary mix of 2D and forestall-movement 3-D animation become a remarkable success and the BBC commissioned masses more episodes. As recently as 2012, Paddington was voted Britain’s high-quality lively man or woman of all time at the British animation awards.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Getting the right voice for Paddington wasn’t easy (a trouble that resurfaced almost forty years later while Colin Firth, who was initially engaged to voice Paddington within the characteristic movie, became changed at quick notice by using the younger Whishaw). “A lot of very well-known humans came and did their bear voices and it wasn’t completely proper – you&#8217;ve got a image in your mind of what it’s like however it doesn’t exist surely. Michael Horden got here in and stated ‘I don’t do voices however I’ll study the script’. So he read the script and he did what grew to become out to be the Paddington voice. As I wrote the scripts I could pay attention his voice pronouncing the dialogue.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The collection added a far wider target market to the person, helped hugely, says Bond, through the timing. “It had the spot after children’s hour and earlier than the nighttime news. It turned into the pleasant of both worlds as it had the children there already after which grown-u.S.A.Coming in for the information and seeing it as properly.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Bond has written different books, different series even. Olga da Polga is the guinea-pig big name of some of chapter books and photograph books – and also the real call of the Bond family guinea pig (I’m brought to Olga wide variety six as she scampers about within the Bond home). There is also a protracted-walking detective comedy collection featuring Monsieur Pamplemousse, a French restaurant inspector. (Bond himself is a Francophile, spending a week each month writing within the flat he rents in Paris.) But it&#8217;s miles Paddington to whom he usually returns.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>However, Paddington’s arrival took Bond by means of surprise. It turned into 1958, the 12 months that his daughter, Karen, who&#8217;s now coping with director of Paddington and Company, turned into born but Bond didn’t set out to jot down a youngsters’s e book. Or even a e book in any respect. “The first e-book commenced lifestyles as a doodle truely due to the fact I had a clean sheet of paper and a typewriter and you understand that nobody else goes to place any words on unless you do. I changed into looking around the room and we had this small bear, which were a form of stocking filler for my first spouse, and I wondered, idly, what it would be like if it became a actual bear that landed on Paddington station and I typed the primary words down. The idea caught my fancy.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>His publisher, Billy Collins, suggested Peggy Fortnum as an illustrator and she or he added the bear to existence on the page. Paddington went on to be drawn by way of Wood, who developed the cool animated film model for the TV series, David McKee (of Elmer and Mr Benn fame) and, maximum recently, RW Alley, who has been illustrating the Paddington books for the reason that Nineteen Nineties. Alley is based in the US. Bond says they have got a “high-quality relationship” and he unearths himself going out on missions along with his camera to take pics of particularly English items that could need to seem inside the heritage of the snap shots, which includes dustcarts and sports grounds. This has led Bond into some Paddington-esque sticky conditions of his own, with safety guards or even the police. “You can’t surely take images in recent times without people accusing you of all forms of matters,” he says, as an alternative bemused.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Bond has no aim of retiring either himself or his undergo. He has just posted a brand new Paddington e-book, Love from Paddington, a group of letters from the undergo to his Aunt Lucy, and has completed 3 chapters of a new novel-period Paddington ebook. “If you’re a writer, humans don’t count on you to retire. I don’t need to retire, and I’m very satisfied and really fortunate that I’m operating. I don’t understand what I’d do if I wasn’t.”</span>
