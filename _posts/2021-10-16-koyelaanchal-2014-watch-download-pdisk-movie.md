    <span>Koyelaanchal is packaged as a saga of the coal mafia of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, however is genuinely just some other tale of how an honest government officer takes on a crime lord.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Review: Saryu Bhan Singh (Vinod Khanna) is the godfather of Rajapur. He is the face of the coal mafia. From poor to wealthy, law enforcement officials and political leaders to killers, absolutely everyone worships him. No one dares to raise their voice in opposition to his atrocities, barring IAS officer Nisheeth Kumar (Suniel Shetty). But Saryu’s henchman/ killing gadget Karua (Vipinno) kidnaps the officer’s toddler, giving upward push to greater random killings.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Koyelaanchal lacks a proper tale. From coal mafia to collector’s toddler to Karua’s exchange of heart to Maoist actions, you hold thinking what the movie is all about! Characters leap in and out of the film randomly. The movement scenes are poorly carried out and the sound consequences are horrible. The intent turned into to show the mafia’s atrocities however that doesn&#8217;t stumble upon at all. Supporting actors ham with no end in sight and a lady forever showing her cleavage doesn’t salvage the bad script.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Though having a robust presence, both Vinod Khanna and Suniel Shetty are really wasted. Vipinno receives the most photos and he fails to deliver. Barring some effective moments (a scene in which Suniel Shetty loses his cool over the laidback government), not anything manages to awaken a response.</span>
