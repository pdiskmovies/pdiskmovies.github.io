    <span>In view of a genuine lilfe instance of illegal exploitation, Megan Griffiths (composing with Richard B Phillips and with assistance from the first casualty Chong Kim) adopts a deliberate strategy to this account of grab and misuse. Hyun Jae (Jamie Chung) is a 19-year-old child at the place of close resistance from her folks which implies she sneaks off for a bit of underage drinking with her buddy however most likely returns home on schedule. Not on the night she meets an appealing fire fighter in a bar, however, on the grounds that what looks like it may hot date transforms into a bad dream after she&#8217;s packaged into the boot of a vehicle. Hyun Jae &#8211; before long renamed Eden by her capturers &#8211; is the furthest down the line obtaining to a &#8216;steady&#8217; run generally by warped lawman Bob (Beau Bridges), who ranches out the young people for cash.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>We finish Eden her introduction and afterward find her as she understands she&#8217;s just with regards to the most seasoned child on the square and begins working her wiles on Bob&#8217;s break dependent lieutenant Vaughan (Matt O&#8217;Leary) trying to guarantee she remains valuable.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Griffiths handles the abuse with care, alluding to what goes on as opposed to focusing on our faces it. Envisioning what may be going to happen to a lady bowing with her cuffed surrenders her head is just as upsetting as watching what occurs. She likewise utilizes the &#8220;modest&#8221; clothing of white vests and pants which the young ladies wear when they&#8217;re not out on a task in a bid to underscore their childhood. The issue here, nonetheless &#8211; and it is a major one &#8211; is that every one of the entertainers are a lot more seasoned than the jobs they are projected in. Chung, for instance, is currently 30 and probably been no less than 28 when this film was shot. While Griffiths&#8217; evasion of the lecherousness that can damage this kind of film is to be adulated, the projecting of these more established entertainers feels like a punch has been pulled. In the event that we truly saw 14 and 15-year-olds arranged in a corrider it would be significantly more influencing than seeing twentysomethings.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Setting that to the side, notwithstanding, this is generally a very much taken care of film that shows the deception of the business end of dealing, putting the accentuation solidly on exactly how homegrown this can be &#8211; with the ladies common US residents who were simply in a tough spot and the culprits not shadowy mafia miscreants but rather cops or ex-Army types hoping to make a fast buck.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Chung is grasping in the focal job and O&#8217;Leary merits recognition as the skittish Vaughan despite the fact that his person, unavoidably, is less all around fleshed out. At times Griffiths takes steps to skate somewhat a lot over the surface &#8211; the young ladies, for instance, appear to adapt astoundingly well considering they are being loaded up with drugs half of the time. In any case, her film is one of the more standard assessments of illegal exploitation &#8211; a reality borne out by is Audience Award at SXSW &#8211; that comes to its meaningful conclusion expressively without falling back on shock strategies.</span>
