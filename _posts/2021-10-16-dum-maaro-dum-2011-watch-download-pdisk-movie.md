He is given the prestigious, yet dangerous venture of cleansing up Goa of its all-pervasive unlawful drug mafia. Pitted in opposition to the effective drug lord Lorsa Biscuta (Aditya Pancholi), a corrupt police department and a host of innocents trapped within the trade &#8212; Bipasha and Prateik Babbar &#8212; will the diehard cop achieve this operation?

    <span>Movie Review: There&#8217;s something about Abhishek Bachchan and his cop act. It always works, in contrast to maximum of his different display screen avatars. Till date, Dhoom remains one of his most memorable performances, where his savoir faire because the sassy policeman stood up commendably to the aura of the horrific guys, John Abraham and Hrithik Roshan. Dum Maaro Dum reiterates the truth that Abhishek appears to be a herbal charmer when it comes to slipping into the footwear of a critical incredibly crooked-really straight cop. His body language, his speak rendition, his lazy zeal and laidback mind-set, provides a slicing facet to the person of ACP Vishnu Kamath, Goa&#8217;s desi Bruce Willis (Diehard) who plays the game in step with his personal regulations.</span>

  <div>
    <span>And Abhishek isn&#8217;t always alone in crafting a host of riveting characters who lend a special cadence to the movie. There is Prateik Babbar and Anaitha Nair&#8217;s teen love story that is going awry, as soon as Prateik receives embroiled in illegal activities. There is Bipasha Basu and Rana Daggubati&#8217;s bindaas seaside romance that lights up the display screen intermittently. There is Mafioso Aditya Pancholi and his imply guy act which flashes fire and brimstone. And there may be the cop camaraderie between Abhishek and his group that adds substance to the proceedings. All the characters are credible and immensely watchable.</span>

  <div>
    <span>Further more, there&#8217;s the stylization of the film and its dramatic narration that makes it a compelling watch. The film slags in locations and needs tightening, however the lull is followed via a tangy twist within the story, which makes up for the occasional yawn.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Shridhar Raghavan writes a thrilling police officers and robbers story which has some quirky banter scripted via Purva Naresh. Add to this Goa captured in sparkling colorings via cinematographer Amit Roy and a peppy music rating through Pritam, and director Rohan Sippy offers you a movie that keeps the popcorn crackling, till the very give up. So plenty so, you don&#8217;t honestly mind the `potty&#8217; lyrics, as Deepika Padukone adds a dusky sheen to them with the Deepika shake. Of direction, there may be Vidya Balan too, along with her winning smiles, in a brief cameo, proving once again that she&#8217;s the maximum in-sync co-star for Abhishek Bachchan. Remember Paa?</span>
