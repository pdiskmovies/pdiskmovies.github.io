    <span>Based on the murder of model Jessica Lall (1999) in an uptown eatery in Delhi and her sister, Sabrina Lall&#8217;s combat for justice, the movie showcases contemporary India as it&#8217;s miles. The mockery of the felony manner, the loopholes in the policing machine, the corruption in the energy circles, the vulnerability of the commonplace Indian: Sabrina&#8217;s (Vidya Balan) conflict &#8212; powered by means of the feisty journalist, Meera Gaity&#8217;s dogged investigation and the people&#8217;s crusade &#8212; brings life to newspaper headlines that also have not been forgotten.</span>

    <span>Movie Review: No One Killed Jessica (NOKJ) is a film that unleashes a myriad emotions in you. The tough information of modern India&#8217;s maximum written about case are widely known by means of nearly anybody but the director Rajkumar Gupta&#8217;s (he&#8217;d already displayed his skills in Aamir) dramatic coping with of the crime, the criminals, the crusaders and the sufferer creates a hurricane, another time.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The movie makes you feel irritated, sad, pissed off, sour approximately the umpteen flaws in our administrative and prison equipment. But greater than all this, it fills you with hope and confidence approximately your very own self. NOKJ reaffirms the electricity and the efficacy of the regular man who can &#8212; and need to &#8212; make the distinction in a dismaying international. Unlike extraordinary hero sagas, the film doesn&#8217;t simply showcase&nbsp; feisty girls &#8212; Sabrina and Meera &#8212; who take at the may of the fecund Indian kingdom. Instead, it throws light on the truth that the complete kingdom got here together, joined the Justice for Jessica crusade and displayed how power without a doubt is living in human beings in place of politicians and their puppets. That&#8217;s the heartening message the movie throws out loud and clean at a time whilst the country of the rip-off-tainted country is not too edifying.</span>

  <div>
    <span>The pitfalls in creating a movie that attracts its drama from actual lifestyles are many.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>NOKJ should easily have unspooled like a soulless documentary that cuts and pastes newspaper headlines in cardboard college fashion. But kudos to the film maker and the performers for infusing whole lot of soul and frame within the film which races across like a hard-punch mystery. From the first smartphone call which informs a sleepy Sabrina of her sister&#8217;s dying to the candle-lit vigil at India Gate, NOKJ is a racy crime drama that relentlessly attracts you in. And when its now not the riveting screenplay (Rajkumar Gupta) and the dialogues which preserve your attention, it&#8217;s miles the actors who seize eyeballs with their energy-packed portrayals. Rani Mukherji&#8217;s rendition of the `complain&#8217;, Meera Gaity &#8212; a balsy, cuss-word-spewing newshound &#8212; is sure to offer you an adrenalin high.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Newcomer Myra&#8217;s Jessica act is full of life and endearing. But it&#8217;s miles Vidya Balan&#8217;s Sabrina who steals the show with her quiet braveness, her absolute ordinariness and her entire disbelief at how someone with a pistol in his hand and power in his head ought to shoot down anyone for a trifling drink. Watch Balan&#8217;s body language and her aimless travels in Delhi&#8217;s public transport and you may apprehend how the common man survives in India: against all odds, albeit with braveness and dignity. A phrase approximately Rajesh Sharma&#8217;s cop act: it&#8217;s poignant and first rate. He&#8217;s the cop who unabashedly takes a bribe for now not beating up the politician&#8217;s son in custody and yet does any and everything to fight for justice.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film has an impeccable first half and will do with a few enhancing in the second half of. But the excessive drama, the arresting performances and the spunky audio tune (Amit Trivedi) make NOKJ a memorable viewing.</span>
