    <span>Ankur Khanna and his companions have quite recently dropped from school and neglect to discover confirmation in any of the esteemed universities in Pune because of their low rates. Do they surrender? No, they turn their backs to the customary training framework which smothers innovativeness and uniqueness and attempt to set up their own substitute school.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: Now this film had a respectable thought. Be that as it may, too bad! Why had it to be so shamefully done. While the primary half figures out how to bring up a couple of appropriate issues on advanced education and parental pressing factor, the subsequent half goes totally cuckoo with a lot of insane characters randomly going around under the stratagem of running a school of the adolescent, by the young, for the young. Ekdum bizarre!&nbsp;</span>

    <span>It&#8217;s the typical I-wannabe-a-demigod, however father doesn&#8217;t comprehend condition which powers Ankur Khanna to look for shelter with Anupam Kher and acknowledge him as his master. Having perused educationist Kher&#8217;s articles on the Bill Gates&#8217; image of instruction which empowers you to arrive at statures, in spite of being secondary school quitters, Ankur persuades Kher to begin his old school called SPIRIT: South Pune Institute of Research and Information Technology. Be that as it may, before he can open the entryways to new learning, Kher is immediately discarded (don&#8217;t know why) and it&#8217;s passed on to Ankur and his band of insane companions to run the organization which offers classes in the craft of cooking, music, enticement, bhaigiri, legislative issues and what-you-will. Obviously, there are no instructors, no tests, no organization, just bedlam, as the understudies apparently go around mentoring themselves. Coach Ashish Vidyarthi is there, yet all he will do is wear grandiose shirts and chug alcohol: he&#8217;s the disappointed companion, thinker and guide.</span>
