  <div>
    <span>A young artist spends a semester abroad in this delicate breeze of a film, whose lopsided story is kept overhead by the inspiring lead entertainers.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Try not to be tricked by the strengthening sounding title of &#8220;Finding You&#8221;: The driving force of author chief Brian Baugh&#8217;s lighthearted comedy isn&#8217;t driven by the lady herself, however by the ones who are ceaselessly positioned in power places that straightforwardly advise her curve. Where it would have been ideal to see the courageous woman opening her own latent capacity, the film rather centers around her finding an intercontinental sentiment with a swank young man, life training from an improbable male partner and a puzzling message from her expired more established sibling. This not-inconsequential erroneous conclusion to the side, be that as it may, bubbly exhibitions from a vivacious troupe make &#8220;Finding You&#8221; an agreeable and convincing female transitioning story.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As though coaxed by the alarm call of the effervescent pop tune on the soundtrack, musician Finley Sinclair (Rose Reid) rises out of the profundities of the tram, an apparently certain young lady haggling New York City&#8217;s excited hurrying around. However, as we before long discover during her bungled tryout at Manhattan&#8217;s lofty music studio, she&#8217;s unreliable when given the spotlight to perform. Her own basic overthinking is seriously hampering her profession desires. With an end goal to escape her head, she takes a semester abroad in Ireland very much like her virtuous, more established sibling Alex, who as of late died, had done at her age.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The karma of the Irish gets scouring going promptly on her trip as she catches a seat in top of the line, unconsciously situated close to megawatt movie star Beckett Rush (Jedidiah Goodacre). His Cheshire feline smile, floppy earthy colored hair and unavoidable charms disappoint her â€” that is, until they find they&#8217;re remaining at a similar pleasant overnight boardinghouse in the interesting ocean side villa of Carlingford.</span>
