  <span>Has it come to this? The movie “Bad Ass” is based on a February 2010 viral video that came to be called “Epic Beard Man” wherein an older white guy got into a fist fight with a more youthful African American man on an Oakland bus over a misunderstanding that may have had racial overtones. It turned into a piece perplexing, truely crazy and perhaps kind of cool.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>In the movie model, Danny Trejo performs a bearded Vietnam vet who fights off two white skinheads from harassing an aged black guy on a bus in Los Angeles, putting off a chain of events so that it will ultimately find him battling a criminal offense syndicate that consists of a corrupt mayor.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The apparent racial realignment of the adaptation is meant to take out any confusion over who was in the proper — the aged man being defended wears a beret for additonal harmlessness — focusing on the extra apparent, much less troubling aspects of the tale as a point of departure.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Writer-director Craig Moss, who previously made a number of parody movies along with the “Twilight” sendup “Breaking Wind,” shrewdly pitches the movie in this kind of manner that it’s frequently tough to inform what’s terrible on purpose or simply badly treated. The shipment shorts and fanny %? Purposely humorous. The slack pacing? Probably now not. The greedy at straws, stretch-it-out sense of the extended plot? Maybe? (And for fans of the unique video, there may be even the signature mispronunciation of “ambulance” as “Amber Lamps.”) Though there seems to be some digital embellishment to the common fighting, with extra spurts of blood after punches, the obvious body-doubles with awful wigs keep the violence from ever getting too intense.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>“Bad Ass” isn’t pretty as immediately-faced ridiculous because the current winking unfashionable-exploitation photographs “Machete” or “Hobo With a Shotgun” nor as instantly-up humorous as the blaxploitation parody “I’m Gonna Git You Sucka,” however any film with a climax which includes&nbsp; hijacked metropolis buses in a sport of hen can’t be taken too severely either. Perhaps it is simply difficult to compete with the atypical spontaneity of something like a viral video; the manner it takes on its personal momentum may be some thing which can’t be replicated.</span>
