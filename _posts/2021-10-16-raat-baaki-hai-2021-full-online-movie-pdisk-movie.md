    <span>On their commitment night, Kartik Sharma&#8217;s life partner Vani Chopra is severely killed. Post which, Kartik disappears and turns into the excellent suspect. Yet, would he say he is the offender or there is something else entirely to the story that requirements to unfurl?&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Raat Baaki Hai Review: Helmed by Avinash Das, the film is set in Rajasthan and the story spins around a night when an effective author, Kartik Sharma (Annup Soni), gets drawn in with well known Bollywood entertainer Vani Chopra (Dipannita Sharma Atwal). On that very night Vaani is discovered dead under secretive conditions and her homicide sets off a progression of misfortunes. Kartik goes on a run and grounds up at a King&#8217;s royal residence where he unintentionally meets his previous sweetheart Vasuki (Paoli Dam). Then again, a sharp-witted cop, Rajesh Ahlawat (Rahul Dev) is roped in to examine the homicide. While questioning every one of the individuals present at the gathering, he discovers that Kartik is missing which makes him the superb suspect of his life partner&#8217;s homicide. Can Ahlawat tackle this secret and deal with the crook?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In light of Atul Satya Koushik&#8217;s Hindi play &#8216;Ballygunge 1990&#8217;, the account of the film is somewhat changed and the foundation shifts from Kolkata to Rajasthan. &#8216;Raat Baaki Hai&#8217; endeavors to be a whodunit that nobody expected, yet it takes a path of least resistance to introduce a secret where the homicide looks counterfeit, and secret scarcely keeps you locked in. The screenplay by Siddharth Mishra looks encouraging toward the start, yet the story gets precarious step by step, particularly when Kartik and Vasuki meet one another and they go on an outing through a world of fond memories to remember their dim past. At first, this anticipation dramatization centers just around the homicide examination (which is shockingly excessively easygoing), however soon the story gets jumbled up previously and existing existences of Kartik, Vasuki and Vani. The peak has some flighty curves in the street which are intriguing to watch. Generally speaking, this 89 minutes tension spine chiller is very unexciting and a dull watch.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Rahul Dev is great as the straightforward cop Ahlawat whose character has conceals of dim all along, but then, he leaves no stone improved to discover reality. Annup Soni convincingly portrayed the nervousness his person goes through. Paoli Dam is looking rich and she makes her quality felt as Vasuki. Rather than simply zeroing in on her appearance and that impeccably hung saree, the film would have worked surprisingly better had it dove further into Dam&#8217;s person.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>&#8216;Raat Baaki Hai&#8217; circles around a homicide examination and the current existences of the lead characters which might have been a fascinating watch yet it comes up short on the right components to engage. Regardless of some known faces and persuading acts, it appears to be a not really exciting tension dramatization.</span>
