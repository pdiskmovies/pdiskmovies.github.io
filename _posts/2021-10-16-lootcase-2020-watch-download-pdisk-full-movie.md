    <span>First time chief Rajesh Krishnan said that he needed &#8216;entertainers&#8217; for his film Lootcase, not simply beautiful appearances. He said he was ready to hold back to track down the right fits for the characters, regardless of whether it required two years. To his favorable luck, he scored each entertainer on his list of things to get right away. In any case, not really luckily for the entertainers, it might not have been the best choice they made.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Lootcase utilizes the abilities of Rasika Dugal, Ranvir Shorey, Gajraj Rao and Vijay Raaz, every one of whom are among the best entertainers working in the country. After Delhi Crime, Manto, Khosla Ka Ghosla, Titli, Badhaai Ho, Monsoon Wedding and Gully Boy, it&#8217;s undeniable why they were on Krishnan&#8217;s list of things to get. However, the film gives them little space to exhibit their ability, looking rather like a deadened task finished as an afterthought. Indeed, even Kunal Kemmu&#8217;s endeavors—who apparently had some good times playing the lead—seem squandered because of the mostly clever content.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <blockquote>
    <div>
      <span>Kemmu plays Nandan Kumar, an expert at the print machine, with an annoying spouse—played by Duggal—and no cash to keep her glad. They live with their child in a minuscule level in Mumbai where sugar, flour and tolerance runs out rapidly. They can&#8217;t generally pay the lease or contemplate sporting family time past the month to month visit to the Chinese food slow down. However, after you witness their glad dates over manchow soup and a sound, customary sexual coexistence, things don&#8217;t appear to be adequately frantic to require mediation by a bag full of money.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  
  <div>
    <span>However, very much like an earnest need to pee in the road, the bag shows up in Nandan&#8217;s life, bringing him quick delivery from his wretchedness. Be that as it may, neither the road nor the bag are his to guarantee. It has a place with a mischievous legislator, played by Gajraj Rao. He utilizes two thugs to move the cash across the city when they are assaulted by the individuals from an adversary pack, the head of which is played by Vijay Raaz. After a muddled shootout, the posses make a flee for their lives, away from moving toward police, leaving the pack awfully covered up on the walkway. This is whenever Nandan chances upon it. Pretending an ethical code, he inquires as to whether the sack has a place with anybody and make a run for it a second after the fact.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>When safely in his arms, he makes the bag his side crush. He gives her a name, pays her day by day visits, stays quiet about her reality from his better half, has significant discussions with her and even loads her with kisses. Nouveau riche Nandan starts spending crunchy Rs 2000 notes with little alert regardless of his better half&#8217;s developing doubt. On the opposite side, the pastor has cajoled cop Ranvir Shorey to track down the missing bag. Presently upwards of three distinct gatherings are searching for Nandan and the bag full of money.</span>
