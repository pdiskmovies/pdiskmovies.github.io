Be that as it may, the overseer of the film has an alternate idea. He&#8217;d prefer not to allow any such settlement. Karthi presently considers Pari (Kristina Akheeva), a young lady he had cherished before he got hitched to Swathi.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The issue with Pari was that she was intrigued uniquely in a live-in relationship and not marriage. However, presently Karthi feels she is the smartest option in life for him. Swathi also is helped to remember Arun (Rahul Ravindran) who used to be astounded by her and has a tendency to use whatever is left of her existence with him. Yet, how might Karthi and Swathi&#8217;s family take their expectation to get separated? There are emotional occasions that give a sign that they maybe won&#8217;t make a particularly intense move.

Would it be advisable for you to watch the film? Not assuming you need to permit a snake into your heaven to wreck your marriage by planting the seeds of separation to you. Stay away. Stay glad.</span>
