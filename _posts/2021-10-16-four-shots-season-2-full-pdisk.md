    <span>The tenacious one of this pack – analytical writer and never-endingly confounded with regards to men Damini Rizvi Roy is kicked out of the very site she worked without any preparation. What&#8217;s more, to proceed with her battle against the evildoers inside the framework, Damini composes a book about the dubious passing of an adjudicator, however there are no takers for this story as it is excessively questionable. In the mean time, her affection life is disintegrating – she is continually tangled between her distractingly gorgeous specialist also known as sexual accomplice Warsi (Milind Soman) and the sort and charming bar proprietor Jay (Prateik). On the off chance that this incertitude wasn&#8217;t sufficient, their once playgirl, exercise center monstrosity companion Umang goes completely gaga over an entertainer whose great days are long finished – Samara Kapoor (Lisa Ray). It&#8217;s an exemplary instance of being dazed by and tanked in adoration and the sexually unbiased beauty from Punjab simply won&#8217;t give up.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The principal season strolled us through their histories and how these four self-hatred, yet enchanting ladies figure out how to get together at their #1 bar, Truck Bar, pretty much consistently to talk about their continuous issues going from workplace issues to annoying sentiments and obviously nursing each other&#8217;s feelings of anguish. The defects are stewing in season one, yet some way or another the garish garments, stilettos and etched faces compensate for the absence of creativity in the plotline. However, with season two, everything simply bubbles over – the journalists (Devika Bhagat, Ishita Moitra, Rangita Pritish Nandy) evaluate each stunt in the romantic comedy exchange – from sexism at work environment to shameless embracement of a lovechild – yet leave everything approaching over our heads without a conceivable arrangement; silly subplots don&#8217;t do well in web series.The track of this 10-scene dramatization is one upside down ride that would have seemed well and good till the mid-2000s (truth be told, it would have been a nice response to &#8216;Sex and The City&#8217; and &#8216;Frantic Housewives&#8217;) yet it holds no importance in this day and age. The content is loaded down with sexual insinuations that gross you out (like the tampon versus hymen conversation) and the reliance on sex to manage each wrecked nail in the house is simply unadulterated oversell and old fashioned. In any case, the music is an invigorating piece of the generally dreary account; whoop to Mikey McCleary and Medha Sahi for the deplorability song &#8216;I Don&#8217;t Do Love Anymore.&#8217;&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Kirti Kulhari, as the judgemental and despondent single parent trapped in an awkward plan, inspires feel sorry for and is engaging to a sensible degree. Sayani Gupta, as the furiously free and tenacious columnist, is frequently excessively noisy and excessively irate. She acts out her dissatisfaction well at the same time, in certain parts, everything appears to be excessively constrained. Maanvi Gagroo&#8217;s go about as a confounded youngster is part irritating and part humorous; she is great as a professional comic however not half as persuading as an adult individual requesting clearness from life. Gurbani is conditioned to her toe in this web series however her modest community young lady making due in-a-major city act is difficult to accept; she is very opulent for that job. As a bundle, the young ladies work to a considerable degree yet the diegesis has no meat for them to work with.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Regardless of the multitude of fixings that have been utilized in this creation to concoct the quickly pre-arranged stock that is &#8216;Four More Shots Please Season 2&#8217;, one can&#8217;t resist the opportunity to ask why these 21st century ladies with all the gut and initiative are depending on Don Juans, sex, more sex and bringing down shots over each goddamn thing.</span>
