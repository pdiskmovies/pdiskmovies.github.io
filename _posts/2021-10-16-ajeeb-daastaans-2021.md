STORY: This treasury addresses the subject of basic misery in cold relationships, broken hearts and mystery characters, position hindrances and sex inclinations, and, above all, how quiet love overcomes the whole gang.&nbsp;

Audit: &#8216;Ajeeb Daastaans&#8217;, as the title proposes, is intensely put resources into the &#8216;large uncover&#8217; or delivering shock worth to every one of its accounts—and there are four of them—and the treasury opens with the primary piece &#8216;Majnu&#8217; by Shashank Khaitan. A lot more youthful and physically freed Lipakshi (Fatima Sana Shaikh) is hitched to sincerely and actually inaccessible neighborhood hooligan Babloo bhaiya. She is a forlorn princess—of political nature—stuck unceasingly in her superb manor. Until a MBA graduate, Raj Kumar (Armaan Ralhan) appears at their doorstep and Lipakshi gets into a hot issue with him. Theirs is a tornado sentiment however one that would free the two: he from all that his dad has accomplished for a selfish Babloo, and Lipakshi, from Babloo himself. Obviously, Shashank Khaitan needed to feature the troubling reality that establish comfort relationships and political contacts however his characters and their passionate interface (or its absence) doesn&#8217;t put on a show of being authentic. Jaideep Ahlawat is searing penises of men for hitting on a spouse he couldn&#8217;t care less about, Fatima Sana Shaikh is blindly enamored with a man she—obviously—has no genuine on-screen science with. Khaitan&#8217;s &#8216;Majnu&#8217; is a hurried story of affection and retribution with no adjusted characters and minimal visual and artistic allure. It is cack-given and needs gravitas at all.&nbsp;

The second story by Raj Mehta—named &#8216;Khilauna&#8217;— is a significant deviation from its archetype and dives profound into financial worries that have been pervasive locally for a very long time. Two stranded at this point convenient sisters are angry with the new neighborhood secretary for separating power which they had sourced through illicit means. The prospective daddy has eyes on Meenal (Nushrat Bharucha) and the woman knows it. The more youthful and upbeat sister Binny (Inayat Verma) is that little beast in mask that does regular tricks with Meenal like an ace. Meenal needs a way in to the secretary&#8217;s home so she can ultimately persuade him to reexamine her rehashed requests for power. Her sweetheart Sushil (Abhishek Banerjee) from the clothing shop is incredulous about the arrangement. &#8220;Kya greetings kar lega? Uske gharme biwi hain. Dekhta hai toh dekhne de,&#8221; Meenal guarantees him. Raj Mehta has a fascinating interpretation of India&#8217;s group differentiation and the abuse and implicit strain that is widespread among haves and the less wealthy. In contrast to the primary story, this one takes as much time as necessary to set up the uniqueness of each character. On the off chance that Meenal is tricky and a brazen pioneer, Binny is her capable second-in-order. Sushil, on the othr handis an adoration struck doggy and addresses that class of men who submit to their oppressors. The peak, which is again filled in as a &#8216;surprising disclosure&#8217;, is one that is thoroughly examined and gives the crowd something to consider upon.&nbsp;

Neeraj Ghaywan&#8217;s &#8216;Geeli Pucchi&#8217; is a finished knockout in this compilation. Ghaywan, through gifted composition and surprisingly astute heading, delivers the predicament of a lady living in an uncalled for world: first, for being a lady in a male-overwhelmed plant, then, at that point for being Dalit and afterward for deciding to unflinching. Ghaywan probably realized he is making something phenomenally significant, which is an incredible entertainer like Konkona Sen Sharma is endowed with the battered-however not-broken Bharti Mandal. Ghyan weds the forlornness of Bharti with an apparently happy and peppy Priya Sharma (Aditi Rao Hydari) whose special life and childhood is a distinct difference to the existence of difficulties Bharti perseveres. Misses out on the advancement to Priya for not &#8216;knowing dominate&#8217;, her pet isn&#8217;t permitted to crap on &#8216;their&#8217; side of the settlement and she isn&#8217;t seen or recognized as a lady. It doesn&#8217;t help either that Bharti is longing for her previous darling.&nbsp;

What truly hangs out in this story is that there are no saviors or guardian angels in Bharti&#8217;s story: a similar Dalit lady who is dealt with cruelly for A) being a lady, and B) for being a Dalit. Ghaywan&#8217;s Meela is a solid, scrappy woman with shades of dark to her persona. She doesn&#8217;t desire after the person who makes her extremely upset, all things being equal, utilizes misdirection and control to grab what ought to have been hers in any case. This sort of intense portrayal of a lady from a minimized local area might have turned out badly yet the narrating is so naturally grasping that towards the end you nearly need Bharti to annihilate Priya. Not for being scheming, no. However, for reprimanding her for being, all things considered, her.&nbsp;

There are not many entertainers who can act out their inward disturbance with simply their face muscles the manner in which Konkona can. &#8216;Geeli Pucchi&#8217; is the same. Aditi Rao Hydari has her own fights as the advantaged kid who doesn&#8217;t have the foggiest idea how to cherish: both in a real sense and allegorically. The entertainer, with her beguiling disposition and honest guiltlessness, depicts an alternate sort of picture for battle: man controlled society, absence of comprehension of her sexual personality and so forth. This story moves starting with one glaring cultural issue then onto the next with sheer perfection and before you know it, you have seen everything in a question of near 30 minutes.&nbsp;

The last venture is by debutant chief Kayoze Irani who transports you into the universe of adoration anthems and eccentric workmanship and specialists meanwhile keeping you in contact with the unforgiving real factors of life and love. Natasha (Shefali Shah) is in a broken marriage and has a hard of hearing little girl. The spouse (Tota Roy Chowdhury) is endeavoring to accommodate his uniquely abled girl and perhaps concoct an innovation based arrangement. In any case, several quarrels and squabbles about missed meals and WhatsApp talks, among other repairable issues in their marriage. She tells Kabir (Manav Kaul), a hard of hearing painter, she had &#8216;one genuine relationship and it&#8217;s finished&#8217;.&nbsp;

&#8216;Ankahi&#8217;— the title of this track—occurs over a time of a couple of days and common sense be doomed for shouldn&#8217;t something be said about&#8217;s to unfurl! The superb music at the foundation and that unmissable voice of Prateek Kuhad returns you to 90s Bollywood when love was less complex, and its show, outwardly spellbinding.&nbsp;

It&#8217;s difficult to wed the ordinariness of existence with an Utopian world yet Irani does it easily. &#8216;Ankahi&#8217; believes that its watchers are keen to figure out the real story thus Irani—fearlessly—leaves a great deal on us to decipher. Presently we don&#8217;t think about you, however we shut our PCs with a major, wide grin on our appearances.
