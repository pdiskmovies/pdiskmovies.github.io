    <span>Vikram Rudraraju (Vishwak Sen) is a cop tormented by PTSD because of a beyond trauma. He works for the Homicide Intervention Team and takes it upon himself to clear up the case of a missing female for private motives; will he be able to do it?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Review: Dr Sailesh Kolanu sincerely intends for HIT to turn into a franchise, and it’s made clear from the get-move whilst he seems to be in no hurry to show something a whole lot approximately his characters. Crime dramas are a genre which can be tough to pull off and to the director’s credit, he manages to do it well with minimal drawbacks. What’s remarkable is how the viewer is driven into the arena Vikram inhabits from the word go, mainly while it’s one which’s suffocating and packed with so much ache.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>A female goes missing at Outer Ring Road and her mother and father are worried out in their mind. The closing man or woman to peer her is a cop (Murli Sharma) who had left her on the location she become closing visible after she assures him that assistance is arriving. Another cop, Vikram, is on a much-needed go away, trying to deal with the pain in his existence, when he gets a distressing name. How Vikram embroils himself in the case of the missing woman, and what does it have to do with the decision he received makes up the story.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Vikram works for the HIT branch against his therapist and female friend Neha’s (Ruhani Sharma) desires. Due to the nature of his task, he’s prone to huge panic assaults that reason him to black out once in a while, be paranoid that his suspects will break out his hold close on every occasion they’re out of his view and fireplace in any form, view or form, appears to be a huge trigger. It’s clean he’s in ache due to a beyond trauma, which is why his shabby appearance and short-temperedness is tolerated even by his superiors. And at the same time as he has a keen sense of odor and deduction capabilities that make him exact at his activity, the query remains at some point of the film, if his shortcomings will ever allow him clear up instances in peace.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The director does a good activity of letting us understand enough approximately Vikram’s trauma to care and stay invested during the film. His love for Neha and the ache deeply embedded in him are proven in bits and pieces, through flashes of his recollections. And this narrative is a specifically formidable desire, seeing as how it’s now not some thing that would sit down nicely with all viewers. But the movie takes its own candy time turning in the belief and at the same time as it’s laudable that it isn&#8217;t some thing you can wager, the way the climax is moved quickly via doesn’t virtually work. But the much less said approximately the plot the better, it’s something that wishes to be watched on-display screen.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Apart from director Sailesh, Vivek Sagar, S Mani Kandan and Garry BH ought to be lauded for doing a stupendous process with setting up the surroundings Vikram inhabits. The tune, cinematography and modifying live actual to the style; bringing thru the pain, suffocation and desperation through the sound and visuals. The detailing is incredible, so are the manner a few scenes are shot, with subtlety without being too on-the-nose. The film also breaks stereotypes inside the maximum subtle of ways.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Vishwak Sen’s performance on the other hand doesn’t usually depart the meant impact. His dialogue shipping, in particular ones with scenes providing Ruhani, seems off. But he nails the scenes in which he’s being sarcastic and funny –when he’s calling out a professor for moral policing, particularly. His performing too wavers, seeming off in certain scenes, even as he just nails it in different ones, and there simply seems to be no in-between when it comes to it. Ruhani Sharma is pretty plain okay in the few scenes she has, whilst Hari Teja shines. Murli Sharma does properly with what he’s provided.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>HIT is certainly now not a film with a view to hold you on the threshold of the seat, but it maintains you engaged sufficient to understand more. With a tighter narrative, better route and performances, this in reality ought to’ve been something else. But that’s not to mention, that the movie doesn’t paintings, because it does, mainly with the massive cliff-hanger on the end promising a sequel worth looking.</span>
