    <span>Harinder Singh aka Harry (Shahid Kapoor), whiles away his time in his native village, watching for the letter to join the Indian Air Force. But earlier than the letter arrives, he falls in love with Aayat (Sonam Kapoor), the displaced Kashmiri girl who lands up within the village when Kashmir falls prey to insurgency. However, the sick-fated romance receives disrupted by using the political events just like the Ayodhya dispute, the Mumbai bomb blasts, the Kargil conflict, the Gujarat riots&#8230;. The international simmers, violence spreads, however love by no means dies as Harry and Aayat keep hoping for a re-union, regardless of the passing years and the turbulent landscape.</span>

    <span>Movie Review: Mausam starts on a stunning be aware. Loads of atmospherics, temper, sentiment and stunning visuals of a sleepy rural backdrop, captured in arresting mode via cinematographer Binod Pradhan make you sit down again determined for an inventive tryst with cinema. Sonam&#8217;s shy femininity as the anguished Kashmir migrant, trapped in alien terrain and Shahid Kapoor&#8217;s boyish buoyancy add a spark to the court cases as does their old style style of romance.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Yes, the allure of the primary half of the film lies in the antique love story which proceeds via unsaid phrases, unexpressed feelings, stolen glances and lots of melody (Pritam Singh). The affair which starts offevolved in 1992, before the demolition of the Babri mosque has an oriental allure to it and makes for some moments of brilliant viewing. It&#8217;s not only Shahid and Sonam, however the whole ensemble forged comprising the villagers that lend a spontaneity to the court cases. The demolition of the mosque and the political turmoil that ensues puts a brake at the smooth banter and reasons the fanatics to separate. Aayat leaves for Mumbai and Shahid joins the Air Force.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>And it is here that director Pankaj Kapur seems to lose his grip, as a minimum partly, on the story which crosses continents and slips on the natural allure and high emotional quotient that made the first 1/2 eminently watchable. The enthusiasts meet once more in Scotland, but a Mozart concert can never truly compensate for the country splendour of misty vegetables, mustard fields and rain soaking wet terraces. Too many comings and goings, conferences and separations, ignored calls and opportunities, spurred on by the cataclysmic political activities of the country, tire you with their repetition, even as the evolution of Sonam into a style diva robs her off her local innocence. Shahid&#8217;s daredevil Air Force pilot too loses a bit of intensity as he battles too many odds: an unfulfilled romance, enemy bunkers on Tiger Hill and a debilitating struggle harm. Cut to the climax &#8212; the fanatics trapped on a burning avenue during the Gujarat carnage &#8212; and things slip absolutely out of hand&#8230;. Too weird, too pointless, bordering on the ludicrous.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Don&#8217;t be dissuaded however, for Mausam has lots to provide to the viewer who doesn&#8217;t mind his cinema languorous, laid returned and moody, with loads of beauty.</span>
