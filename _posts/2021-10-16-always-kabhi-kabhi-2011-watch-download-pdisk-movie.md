  <span>The movie looks on the lifestyles of a group of students during the last 12 months in their school existence. The parental and peer organization stress, the forget, the misunderstandings, the primary stirrings of affection, heartbreak and the whole burden to be triumphant: it&#8217;s an try and seize the angst of developing up before you absolutely come of age.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Movie Review: Not goodbye ago Roshan Abbas, then an lively theatre character, had directed this movie as a musical referred to as Graffiti. The play changed into successful and had several successful indicates because it reflected the existence of teens who had been nonetheless burdened approximately the selections in lifestyles. Today, he has transformed the identical script right into a film, but mockingly, it lacks the panache that the play boasted of.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The problems are smooth to matter. First, and most significantly, the film is a youngsters-orientated tale but completely lacks the amusing and games which might be associated with this generation. There is a standard lack of zeal in the lawsuits and the pranks that the lads and girls play within the study room border at the juvenile. The final year school room of Always Kabhi Kabhi in no manner reflects a modern classroom of nowadays. All that they do for amusing is move for some antiseptic pool parties or kick back in a nearby club called Hellfire.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Secondly, the parental issues are all so very predictable. The pretty lady (Giselle Monteiro) is being pressured to miss college and forget about her boyfriend so that it will give attention to a modelling and acting profession by means of an bold mother. The school topper is given just one option via domineering dad: MIT or not anything. The rebellious youngster, hungry for her mother and father interest, continues slipping off to Goa along with her boyfriend. And the mortified son, caught in a drug rap, is not able to return easy earlier than his mother and father and seek their help.&nbsp;</span><span>It&#8217;s all foregone and predictable other than being inordinately lengthy. School is anguish; school is ecstasy. Always Kabhi Kabhi captures neither and treads the staid middle floor.</span>
