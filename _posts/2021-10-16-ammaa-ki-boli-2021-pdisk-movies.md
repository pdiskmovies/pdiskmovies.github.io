    <span>Amaash Films, Next Entertainment and Street Act Productions&#8217; Ammaa Ki Boli (UA) is about a family which fosters a passionate bond over a bike.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Sajan Agarwal&#8217;s story and screenplay have a mocking flavor. While that is agreeable at places, the amusement remainder isn&#8217;t steady. Further, the story-line is slender to the point that it can&#8217;t support the crowd&#8217;s advantage in the dramatization for a really long time. Sajan Agarwal&#8217;s exchanges are clever at a few spots.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Farrukh Jaffer makes a fine showing as Ammaa. Sanjay Mishra performs well overall. Govind Namdeo is really powerful. Hrishitaa Bhatt makes a decent showing. Himani Shivpuri and Ishtiyak Khan are satisfactory. Zakir Hussain is acceptable. Sitaram Panchal is reasonable. Priyal Patil loans normal help.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Narayan Chauhan&#8217;s heading is not really good or bad. Manoj Santoshi&#8217;s music score is conventional as are Sajan Agarwal&#8217;s verses. Jojo Khan&#8217;s movement is utilitarian. Saptarshi Pratim makes a normal showing of the camerawork. Sets (Dipankar Mondal) are OK. Aseem Sinha&#8217;s altering should have been more tight.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>All in all, Ammaa Ki Boli doesn&#8217;t have a lot to make an imprint at the ticket windows. Truth be told, it will go to a great extent unseen.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>

    <span>Delivered on 26-2-&#8217;21 at City Light (day by day 1 show) and another film of Bombay through Neev Enterprises. Exposure and opening: exceptionally poor. â€¦ .Also delivered everywhere.</span>
