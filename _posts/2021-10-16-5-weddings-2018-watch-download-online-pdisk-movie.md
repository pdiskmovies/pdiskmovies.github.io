<div>
  <span>An American columnist goes to India where she beats her own hesitations about the way of life, individuals and finds more than she had expected to.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Audit: Shanaya Singh (Nargis Fakhri) isn&#8217;t an enthusiast of Indian weddings, India as a spot or her dad. Be that as it may, life gives her a troublesome hand where she needs to travel to Chandigarh to cover not one, but rather five weddings assuming she needs the top occupation at her design magazine. To add to her issue, her mom requests that she track her dad, who left them when Shanaya was a young lady, and convey a package to him. Like a decent correspondent and a loyal little girl, she takes care of business and flies to India where she finds Harbhajan Singh (Rajkummar Rao), a cop relegated to contact with her and stops her on the off chance that she misbehaves and records a negative story. It could be hard to misbehave covering weddings for a style magazine, however Shanaya ends up risking upon the sorry way that transsexual or Hijras are treated in India and chooses to compose a basic piece on it.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>It would have worked out better had the producer zeroed in on one Indian wedding rather than five on the grounds that the numbers don&#8217;t add a ton to the plot other than a couple of episodes. Shanaya inserts herself freely with the weddings which make the story appears to be less credible. She is likewise not shown investing a lot of energy with the transsexual local area to get any believable story which she is shown composing.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The science among Nargis and Rajkummar is unconvincing. While effectively Rajkummar pulls off his job as a torn cop between his affection and his work, Nargis doesn&#8217;t carry a lot to the table. The music is run of the mill Punjabi pop blended in with some people, however doesn&#8217;t add a lot of significant worth. The film attempts to shuffle the engaging point with a social reason which doesn&#8217;t work. With a guessable plot and a wandering story line, going to these &#8216;5 weddings&#8217; ends up being an overwhelming undertaking.</span>
