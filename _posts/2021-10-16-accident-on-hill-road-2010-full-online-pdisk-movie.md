    <span>Celina Jaitley hits passerby Farooque Shaikh on Hill Road and runs&#8230;She leaves the vehicle in her carport, with the as yet breathing casualty wedged in the windshield and releases a wait-and-see game that heads towards a ridiculous peak.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: The film depends on a genuine occurrence and elements Abhimanyu Singh. Recall the entertainer who left with your praise as the understudy chief in Anurag Kashyap&#8217;s free thinker film Gulal? All the more significantly, the film gives a job that should not be taken lightly to Celina Jaitley as the attendant who appears to lose all her altruism in a monstrosity situation. What&#8217;s more, in case that is adequately not, it denotes another arrival of the capable Farooque Shaikh to standard film after the grievous Saas Bahu aur Sensex.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="separator">
    <span>Tragically, nothing appears to work in support of its. Abhimanyu Singh&#8217;s medication peddlar act is excessively tiny and inadequately created to really have an effect. Farooque Shaikh as the quick in and out casualty spends such a large number of abnormal minutes lying topsy turvy on screen. What&#8217;s more, Celina Jaitley basically shouts her lungs out or hotly swallows down bourbon, vodka for sure you-will to show her dread, outrage and desperation as the one who would lose everything &#8211; her future in London, her existence with beau Singh &#8211; after some hard-core boozing.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="separator">
    <span>All set for a meeting with the Red Cross, Celina goes through the evening celebrating with companions. Be that as it may, a lot of Ecstasy and liquor send her into a fit and entangle her in an accident on her way back home. Rather than submitting to the law, the lady frenzies and crashes off into her carport, with the person in question (Farooque Shaikh) hanging and frantically asking for help. She attempts to wrap up the shameful story with the assistance of her sweetheart, Abhimanyu Singh, who continues to pop some more pills into her. Normally, the out-of-center pair can scarcely control occasions which totally leave hand. As does the film.</span>
