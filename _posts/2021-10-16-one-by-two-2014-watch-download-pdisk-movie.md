    <span>Amit and Samara are&nbsp; lost souls within the metropolis with exclusive desires and dreams. Until future designs a brand new road for them.</span>

    <span>Review: Wait to be seated, within the meanwhile check the menu tonight. The quantities are big, so everything is served one with the aid of . In the ‘Specials’ we have a daringly distinctive product of Bollywood, Abhay Deol. With a storyline that wants to bounce out of mundane romcoms. Some spark of comedy, some feathery sense-precise scenes. And a few accurate music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) for the hungry soul. We’ll come lower back to what’s ‘now not warm’ on the menu, for now let’s dig in.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Everything in Amit Sharma’s (Abhay) existence is unbearably uninteresting. Starting with his call, of direction. He’s in a permanently pakaoed (like deep fried French fries) and purposeless country of thoughts – with a nagging mom (Rati) who buys him stretchable undies and emotionally blackmails him to choose for a fast-restore boredom answer referred to as shaadi. His college sweetheart dumps him for being as mundane as manchow soup on a date. And to pinnacle it, way to his ‘gas’tronomical indulgences (blame it on ‘pakaoed paneer’) he’s a great ol’ fart too. He believes, when existence throws shit at you, you want lots of lavatory paper. Phrrr!</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>On the other aspect, Samara (Preeti – pretty, incredible confident and suggests promise) raised by using unmarried-mother (Lillete–exact act!) is meaning to be famous dancer by means of winning a dance fact display. She’s exasperated along with her mom who has a date with the daru bottle every night, and an ex-boyfriend who can bed anything for gain. Her mantra is ‘smooth up the shit’. Amit and Samara’s paths almost pass, however they pass over each different on every occasion by means of a cut up 2nd. Eventually, after all of the ‘shit occurs’ and is flushed out; destiny has sparkling plans for them.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Debutante Devika’s idea might appearance excellent on paper, however onscreen it dissipates like diarrhoea. Strung with some laughable scenes, it scrambles around with too many plots crafted like episodic sitcoms. It intends to reflect the psyche of the ‘wuzdat’ technology however fast crumbles like an out-of-love, casual sex courting. Abhay is right in his component, but after his exceptional performance in ‘Raanjhanaa’ he’s now not at his peak here.</span>
