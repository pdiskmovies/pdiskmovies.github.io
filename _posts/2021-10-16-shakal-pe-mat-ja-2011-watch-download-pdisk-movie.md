    <span>A bunch of beginner documentary filmmakers turn out to be in problem when they&#8217;re caught photographing planes on the Delhi Airport with out permission. Arrested via the airport police, headed by the bumbling Raghuvir Yadav, they are viewed as potential terrorists, until they in reality foil a terroristâ€™s plot to plant a bomb in one of the flights starting off from the airport.</span>

  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: Brave effort with the aid of a group of children to make a film which has been co-produced via Hrishitaa Bhatt (actor) and directed by way of Shubh, the hero of the movie. There is a sincere effort by means of these newcomers to script and create a comedy of mistakes concentrated spherical the problem of terrorism and the paranoia it has created throughout. But critically, can not say how apt it&#8217;s far to fool round with one of these touchy topic and create parodies out of terror czars like Osama. Here, you&#8217;ve got Omama (Zakir Hussain) and his terror network, Al-Baqaeda, hellbent on growing mayhem in India and outdoing the antics of Osama. Of path, Omama and his jihadis are bumbling buffoons. Now how humorous is that?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Moreover, the movie is humorous, best in bits and components and by and large remains an novice attempt at making a comedy. There is an excessive amount of and too loud historical past music, meant to make you laugh, if you pass over the humour. You frequently do. And there are too many characters going for walks around helter-skelter in a single venue, the Delhi Airport, to maintain the inordinate length of the movie. The use of the burqa clad figures as decoys and the pink bag as the bomb is simply too stereotypical, considering this could were an modern, out of the container, youthful vision.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In phrases of overall performance too, the film has not anything to showcase, except the efforts of veterans like Saurabh Shukla, the affable ATS cop and Raghuvir Yadav, the Dilli cop, who maintain the drama flowing. A bit extra schooling and gravitas of their approach toward the craft, then maybe there may be a film to observe out from this younger group of wannabe filmmakers.</span>
