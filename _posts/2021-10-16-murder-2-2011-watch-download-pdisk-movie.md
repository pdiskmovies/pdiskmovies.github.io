    <span>Ex-cop Arjun has crossed over on the opposite facet of the regulation and prefers to earn his dwelling the underhand manner. But life begins to exchange whilst a pimp hires him to nab a serial killer who is murdering his girls. Danger threatens to strike domestic while the killer sets eyes on Arjun&#8217;s female friend (Jacqueline Fernandes) and bookmarks her as his next target.</span>

    <span>Movie Review: For all people who loved Murder, a phrase of caution. Murder 2 lacks the mellifluity and the passionate chemistry among the lead players. Of direction, there are lots of severe bodily encounters between Emraan Hashmi and Jacqueline Fernandes, but their relationship is largely a lame duck, with Jacqueline begging for extra (love) and Emraan insisting `Enough!&#8217; In truth, you even have the female friend groveling within the streets, pleading for his interest. This is so not like the sizzle and hiss between Mallika Sherawat and Emraan in the first film.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Actually, there&#8217;s enough in the movie to raise the hackles of diehard feminists, however obviously this mighty cocktail of intercourse and violence was never meant for the feminists. So, we will set apart this problem altogether and move on to another aircraft. Murder 2 works in most cases due to its tempo. The first 1/2 is racy and scuttles via because the gruesome killer closes on his sundry kills. The second half of does have Emraan meandering aimlessly on a futile look for a victim and he does take too long to shut in.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But any sluggishness in pace is made up by the performances. While Emraan is his common edgy self, Prashant Narayanan is genuinely riveting. Jacqueline Fernandes replays her role as succulent eye candy and the relaxation of the ensemble cast are competent.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>There may be not anything unique approximately the tale, but Murder 2 has enough to give the masses a mast time.</span>
