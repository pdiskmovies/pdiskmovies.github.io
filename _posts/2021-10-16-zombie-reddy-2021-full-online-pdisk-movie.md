  <div>
    <span>A game engineer and his companions head to Kurnool to go to their companion&#8217;s wedding. Yet, something substantially more threatening as opposed to heavenly pelli bhojanam anticipates them there.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Audit: Zombie comedies are not another type for any ghastliness fan out there, think more Shaun of the Dead, Go Goa Gone and Zombieland than World War Z and I am Legend. Furthermore, Prasanth Varma endeavors to give old fashioned type a weighty portion of desi tadka, particularly Telugu popu, complete with factionism, mother feeling, love, companionship, manipulating, head-slamming and that&#8217;s only the tip of the iceberg. Does he figure out how to pull it off? Well…&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Mario (Teja Sajja) is a game engineer whose new game is nearly slamming. Joined by his group, which incorporates Maggi (Daksha Nagarkar), an ardent gamer, he heads to Rudravaram in Kurnool to get his companion&#8217;s (RJ Hemanth) help in getting the coding right. His companion is getting hitched and Nandini Reddy (Anandhi) is likewise there to go to the celebrations. The diverse group before long end up fending off zombies in genuine rather than on their versatile screen and they should figure out how to make all the difference before the infection spreads.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Prasanth Varma makes an honest effort to make Zombie Reddy a great watch – there are sufficient lethargic movement &#8216;height&#8217; scenes that will make you need to whistle and the cosmetics division also works effectively with the zombies. The battles in the film are splendidly arranged, both when they&#8217;re battling people and zombies. Imprint K Robin&#8217;s music – both the score Go Corona Go and the BGM unquestionably make an imprint, so does Anith&#8217;s cinematography. Prasanth, in his brand name style, even drops a significant clue regarding how it&#8217;ll all end, directly toward the start of the movie. There&#8217;s no question that Zombie Reddy is an actually impressive film.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>What is a significant let down anyway is its humor. For something that is made look like a zombie satire, there are few seconds to a great extent in the 2-hour-20-minutes in length runtime that genuinely make you laugh. Same ol&#8217; jokes that pass off for satire in Tollywood are reused . The attributes these zombies have are not used to the furthest reaches. Covid and the lockdown are sayings that appear to be powerfully embedded. What additionally feels like a cop out is the manner by which Prasanth requires some investment to guarantee you put resources into his characters (a great deal of the main portion of the film goes in this), then, at that point proceeds to present more characters trying to play with your feelings. The composing is only not as sharp or smart as we&#8217;re utilized to in Awe or even Kalki. Consistency is the thing that lets this film down from being splendid by the day&#8217;s end.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Zombie Reddy has its minutes and all the cast, including Teja, Anandhi and Daksha appear to mess around with what they&#8217;re advertised. This is definitely not a terrible film using any and all means, if by some stroke of good luck Prasanth had not gone down the anticipated course, it would&#8217;ve been something else. Give it a possibility this end of the week on the off chance that you love zombies yet hold your assumptions under tight restraints.</span>
