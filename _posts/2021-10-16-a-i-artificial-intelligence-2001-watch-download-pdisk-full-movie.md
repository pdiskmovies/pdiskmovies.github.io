  <span>Stanley Kubrick always alluded to the story as &#8220;Pinocchio.&#8221; It mirrored the tale of a manikin who dreams of becoming a real kid. And what, after all, is an android however a manikin with a PC program pulling its strings? The venture that eventually became Steven Spielberg&#8217;s &#8220;A. I. Artificial Intelligence&#8221; (2001) was abandoned by Kubrick because he wasn&#8217;t satisfied with his approaches to its central character, David, an android who appears to be a real little kid. Believing special impacts wouldn&#8217;t be adequate and a human actor would appear to be excessively human, he surrendered the task to his friend Spielberg. Supposedly he made that decision after being impressed by Spielberg&#8217;s special impacts in &#8220;Jurassic Park,&#8221; yet perhaps &#8220;E. T.&#8221; was also an influence: If Spielberg could create an alien who evoked human emotions, could he do likewise with an android?</span>
