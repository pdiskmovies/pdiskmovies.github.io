    <span>I Am Kalam is a film about an underprivileged child who is inspired by India&#8217;s erstwhile President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam and aspires to grow up to be a good individual like him. While the basic inclination for a film like this is show the triumph of the kid&#8217;s aspirations by the hands of the President himself with a cameo in the climax, I Am Kalam refrains from any such awesome depiction and remains established. Anyway despite having a realistic methodology, the film remains optimistic all through and there is not a snapshot of despair.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Chotu (Harsh Mayar), a little kid, is abandoned by his mom at a roadside dhaba to function as an assistant and backing his destitute family. While delivering food at the close by heritage lodging, he befriends a kid of his age, Ranvijay Singh (Husaan Saad) who is a relative of an erstwhile illustrious family that currently runs the inn. The sharp eyewitness and quick-student Chotu is aided by his friend Ranvijay in his journey for education. Further, on learning that President Abdul Kalam too experienced a few hardships in his childhood, Chotu rechristens himself as Kalam and aims to be actually like him.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>However the protagonist is neediness struck, the film never emphasizes on the inadequacy in his life yet is fairly centered around his pursuit for information. The bright essence of Chotu and the energetic mind-set of the film never make the narrative distressing. Add to it, his tiff with a colleague (Pitobash Tripathy) clears a path for some hilarious minutes. The screenplay by Sanjay Chauhan is very much carved and keeps you riveted through its runtime. The writing is multidimensional yet the storytelling by director Nila Madhab Panda is totally simple and effective. He blithely establishes the innocent and pure bonding between the two young men that goes past the divide of their social status.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>While the film sets Abdul Kalam as the good example, at the same time it never digs profound into his life history or goes to give him a narrative length tribute. Kalam&#8217;s reference is simply used to the degree that it can fill in as a well-suited motivation for Chotu. The film only mentions how Kalam confronted difficulties as a child yet proceeded to turn into the main individual in the country. Likewise, the honorable choice of the inspiration separates the film a class from other juvenile endeavors like Nanhe Jaisalmer which had a similar topic and setting. On an equal note, the film inconspicuously addresses the practically excess order of sovereignty in democratic reign, faintly reminding of Satyajit Ray&#8217;s Shatranj Ke Khiladi .&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The sidetrack of Gulshan Grover (as the dhaba &#8211; proprietor) being enticed by a French tourist Lucie (Beatrice Ordeix) has its light minutes and, all the more importantly, is shrewdly integrated with Chotu&#8217;s track. Both have trusts from Lucie â€“ one anticipates love and other anticipates education from her, which are terminated with her unforeseen exit. The film endeavors to support the ideology of &#8216;difficult work over karma&#8217; however with the climax that it settles on, the philosophy appears to be far from being obviously true.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>While the film doesn&#8217;t flaunt an independent soundtrack, director Nila Madhab Panda utilizes music as an effective instrument in his storytelling. Especially effective is the scene where musicians from different countries and societies strike a harmony, making way for an ideal agreement at the roadside dhaba . Another diamond of a scene is when Chotu vents out his frustration through music in the middle of the night in the dry dull desert.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The climax where one child wins the school competition while other is announced as thief makes for a compelling differentiation. The culmination might appear to be to some degree convenient yet the film closes with a beam of expectation. While it offers an unpretentious comment on child work like the new delivery Stanley Ka Dabba , I Am Kalam essentially highlights the importance of child education for a superior generation.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Brutal Mayar, as the protagonist, is totally agreeable before the camera and seems normal in each frame. Regardless of whether it&#8217;s an interesting scene or a dramatic second, he is amazingly confident and each bit deserving of the National Award. Husaan Saad supplements him at each progression and radiates an innocent appeal. Gulshan Grover will play a solid person after a hiatus and places in a compelling demonstration. Pitobash Tripathy as the Amitabh Bachchan fan has his minutes.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>With a child protagonist, I Am Kalam gives an important message particularly to the grown-up audience on how every child has a basic right for education and to live his dream.</span>
