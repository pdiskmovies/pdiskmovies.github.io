    <span>In the novel on which this touchy blockbuster is based, Richard Matheson offered a perfect sci-fi twist on the vampire mythos, imagining a world-destroying spore which would transform ordinary people into blood-lusting animals of midnight. However, despite retaining the changed vamp danger, Akiva Goldsman and Mark &#8216;Poseidon&#8217; Protosevich&#8217;s script, as realized by MTV graduate Francis Lawrence, better takes after a werewolf or Dr. Jekyll. By day, it&#8217;s a limber, insightful and especially effective drama. By night, it&#8217;s a drooling, lurching, crushingly stupid and clumsily executed VFX disaster.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Sunrise. Keenly employing the sharp eye of Lord Of The Rings lenser Andrew Lesnie, Lawrence presents to us a New York liberated from all human presence. Shoulder-height grass drifts lazily in Times Square, disturbed simply by the occasional group of deer. High rises still yell of the glories of mankind&#8217;s achievements, however with nobody to hear them they serve just to project long shadows.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In one sense it&#8217;s terrifying &#8211; the Mary Celeste as an entire conurbation. However it&#8217;s additionally strangely beautiful &#8211; a city where nature has regained her hold and the tiniest animal sounds are at this point not covered by the deafening hack of engines.&nbsp;</span>

    <div>
      <span>At the point when we&#8217;re introduced to this scene&#8217;s just human inhabitant &#8211; one Robert Neville (Will Smith), who is conveniently both highly militarily trained and a brilliant virologist &#8211; he&#8217;s seemingly enjoying his barren environment, redlining a games vehicle through town, his faithful canine companion Sam (best animal execution of the decade, say us) gazing happily out of the traveler window. It&#8217;s an incredible opening arrangement, especially when it transpires that Neville&#8217;s really on the chase, rifle in lap, seeking some venison to enhance his tinned provisions.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  
  <div>
    <span>For a big studio classification film, I Am Legend goes a surprisingly long approach to investigate brain science, and Smith boldly dives headfirst into the mind of a no human individual&#8217;s contact for just about 40 months.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The little details ring valid, like when Neville chides his canine for not eating her vegetables &#8211; he&#8217;s anthropomorphised her so totally that he&#8217;s neglected she&#8217;s a carnivore. Ignore the predictably dodgy science and plot-fissures, and you have a tentpole picture that doesn&#8217;t, for once, insult its audience&#8217;s intelligence. Untilâ€¦&nbsp;</span>

      <span>Nightfall. Before we sink our teeth in, we should make one thing understood: having cut his incisors on infernal comic-book adaptation Constantine, Lawrence realizes how to wrench tension and apply a shock. Along these lines, in its earlier minutes, I Am Legend plays on our primal anxiety toward the dull like a maestro. Be that as it may, with regards to the blood-lapping &#8220;dull searchers&#8221;, Lawrence&#8217;s inadequacies come crashing through. A more experienced director would likely have taken a more smart, less profligate way to deal with this movie&#8217;s beasts. As would a filmmaker who was &#8211; like Danny Boyle, helming the superior 28 Days Later &#8211; compelled to work on a considerably more limited financial plan.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>All things considered, what are the dim searchers? Skinny, pale, hairless individuals with an extraordinarily progressed metabolism. So why for heaven&#8217;s sake did Lawrence decide to make them unadulterated CG conjurations? What&#8217;s more, what dismally dire CG it is, as well. Lawrence&#8217;s &#8216;vampires&#8217; are cartoonish ghosts, evaporators of dread who mercilessly inhale all the air so ingeniously woven during the daylight hours. Going full CG was the most exceedingly awful artistic decision Lawrence might have made &#8211; shy of having the general population of New York out of nowhere leap out from behind the Empire State and yell &#8220;April foo-ool!&#8221; at Neville prior to cutting to the credits.</span>
