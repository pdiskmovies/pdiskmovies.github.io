    <span>Gana (Naga Shaurya) gets back to India for his sister Priya&#8217;s (Sargun Kaur Luthra) wedding. Be that as it may, when she attempts to commit suicide, he discovers she&#8217;s pregnant yet doesn&#8217;t have the foggiest idea how. How he finds the one who did this to his sister and innumerable different young ladies shapes the story.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Survey: Ramana Teja&#8217;s introduction film is eager, on the grounds that Aswathama needs to tell the story not simply of a disappointed everyday person hoping to chase down a maniac, but since it additionally requires some investment to build up the corruption of the one carrying out the abhorrent things. The film probably won&#8217;t invest as much energy on the main bad guy as it does on the hero, falling in a dead zone between investigating its maximum capacity and uncovering the main enemy too early, however Aswathama figures out how to pull off the story in spite of the hitches. You will in any case see the crudeness in the procedures, particularly in case you&#8217;re a devotee of the class, however it&#8217;s a decent endeavor.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Gana (Naga Shaurya) has been infatuated with his sister Priya (Sargun Kaur Luthra) since she was conceived. He comes to India since she&#8217;s getting drew in to Ravi (Prince Cecil) and exactly when he thinks everything is going fine and dandy, he risks upon her attempting to end her own life. A stunned at this point understanding Gana discloses to her he will help her regardless and she reveals to him she&#8217;s pregnant. The issue is she doesn&#8217;t have a clue how and the stage is set for the frantic pursue a sibling proceeds to find his sister the solution she merits and needs. Additionally in this story are four anglers, an elderly person, a mental case and his dependable friend – the diverse team hurting the young ladies who have comparative stories to Priya.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The manner in which Ramana Teja draws an obvious conclusion that graph across the scene of beautiful Vizag and its dirty by-paths of Jalaripeta is honorable. What isn&#8217;t is the time he spends wandering in the primary half prior to cutting to the chase. The entire track among Gana and his better half Neha (Mehreen Pirzada) simply doesn&#8217;t work and she appears to simply exist in the story as an awkward extra person for the sibling sister couple, somebody he can shout at when disappointed and request help when required in light of the fact that he surely doesn&#8217;t figure he can impart his mysterious to her. Sri Charan Pakala&#8217;s two part harmony and a wedding number go squandered in the emergency and the film sparkles just when it gets to the current issue.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Naga Shaurya makes an OK showing with regards to depicting feelings for reasons unknown. His aggravation and disarray in key scenes unquestionably don&#8217;t come through. His disappointment and outrage function admirably for the activity scenes which work generally. Mehreen Pirzada is sufficient however squandered in a job that gives her restricted extension. Sargun likewise charges well. Jisshu Sengupta as the psychopathic scientific pathologist fills the role alright. Ramana Teja, on paper, appears to need to show how his person gradually unwound to where he&#8217;s today yet while he sets out to show the degree of his person&#8217;s debasement on-screen, the manner in which he hustles through it never lets the gravity his underhandedness set in. Ankith Koyya works really hard as the youthful Dr Manoj Kumar, exhibiting the start of the destruction well.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Whatever irregularities you feel in the film are for the most part enveloped with the history however the set-up in the main portion of the film and the way the uncover occurs in the subsequent half appear to be incoherent. Ghibran&#8217;s BGM works regardless of whether it&#8217;s not his best but rather it figures out how to take care of business. Garry BH&#8217;s altering is uneven in parts and Manojh Reddy&#8217;s camerawork is OK. The manner in which Gana at long last zeroes down on Dr Manoj as the guilty party is normal and in light of dumb karma however the thinking probably won&#8217;t work for everybody. The rushed peak also is plain OK.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Aswathama conveys what it guarantees – an arresting story and heaps of activity. Ramana Teja makes a decent introduction by adhering to the current subject without a lot of deviation. In case you&#8217;re a bad-to-the-bone spine chiller fan, you may in any case be left baffled by certain parts since you don&#8217;t connect with however much you should, yet the film is as yet a respectable watch for the end of the week. The violence and degeneracy anyway mean it&#8217;s most certainly not for the cowardly.</span>
