<span>Shabri (Isha Koppikar), an sincere, tough running slum dweller, wants to lead a decent life and make sure an equally decent one for her brother and mother. Now it&#8217;s a hard mission when the underworld has its tentacles well and genuinely drawn across the underbelly of Mumbai. And if the poor and destitute manage to escape its dragnet, there&#8217;s always the vicious police department waiting to unharness its terror on the powerless. Shabri&#8217;s gangster story starts when she avenges her brother&#8217;s death in police custody and units her eyes on the nearby mafia overlord as her subsequent goal.</span>

<span>Movie Review: This one can also hint its antecedents to the Ram Gopal Varma faculty of film making &#8212; yes, RGV is the producer &#8212; but, there is an originality to the film which overrides the familiarity of the genre. Also, the movie has been lying around in the cans for quite some time now, though, it does not have a dated exceptional. And it really is due to the fact there is not some thing new approximately the plot which follows the ordinary RGV layout as it strains the birth of a gangster from among the not unusual guy.</span>

<span>The novelty of the film lies in it&#8217;s narrative fashion, the stark black and white canvas and the gritty, sensible performances through the ensemble cast. It&#8217;s a tough-hitting, non-fussy narration of the occasions that remodel a no-nonsense slum dweller right into a fearless, dangerous killer and a scheming gangster with Isha Koppikar lending depth to the lead person, Shabri. She pitches in a restrained portrayal of the archetypal down and out woman who appears to have lost everything, but her by no means-say-die spirit. Despite the tumult in her life, emotions are usually kept at bay and movement speaks louder than words. An similarly riveting performance comes from Zakir Hussain &#8212; usually a delight to watch &#8212; because the diehard cop who performs his personal little video games to make certain some exact prevails over the enveloping evil.</span>
