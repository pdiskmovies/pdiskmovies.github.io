    <span>Bobby Deol, Suniel Shetty and Irrfan Khan are a trio of philandering husbands who do not think twice earlier than being untrue to their better halves, Sonam Kapoor, Celina Jaitley and Rimmi Sen. Enter marriage therapist, Akshay Kumar, who&#8217;s determined to educate them a lesson and convey them back to the happy own family fold.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: Anees Bazmee appears to be re-visiting familiar terrain together with his new film. Thank You is closely inspired by means of his earlier comic caper, No Entry, in which Salman Khan had the hard mission of curing a motley organization of errant husbands from their persistent infidelity. This time, it&#8217;s far Akshay Kumar who wields the baton &#8212; or is it the flute &#8212; to underscore the sanctity of the institution of marriage. Is this a case of gambling secure for the director who has these days burned his arms at the box workplace or is it a drought of tale thoughts that appears to be Bollywood&#8217;s largest scourge?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Repetition notwithstanding, Thank You ends up as timepass fare, although it isn&#8217;t always as rollicking as No Entry. The first half of the film appears to be an workout in nothingness and has you fidgeting on your seat as you try to look for the rare laughs in a script that is supposed to be humorous. The bit-on-the-aspect sequences of the three husbands are hardly hilarious nor does the fuming better halves membership set the screen ablaze with hysteria. It is only within the second 1/2 that the film acquires form and substance and has you grinning at positive goof-ups. Akshay Kumar&#8217;s complex plans to set the three marriages immediately offers scope for actors like Irrfan Khan and Suneil Shetty to kick up a bit of amusing, although Bobby Deol has hardly ever any humour tailor-made into his position. By and massive, he remains dour and indignant as he begins to suspect his candy wife Sonam of adultery. The ladies, on their part, primarily stay beauty with Sonam looking terribly out of sync, Rimmi no longer being allowed to play her feisty self and Celina being forced to do the disappearing act for a big a part of the movie.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>So what&#8217;s humorous about Thank You? It&#8217;s the men who reiterate the worn-out cliche that fidelity is not an intrinsic part of male body structure. Add to this the excessive manufacturing values &#8212; glitzy locales, jazzy styling &#8212; and Pritam&#8217;s pop numbers and you&#8217;ve got a movie that may be a median weekend getaway. Nothing extra, not even Mallika Sherawat&#8217;s object range.</span>
