    <span>The trailer of The Married Woman fascinated me to figure out how the existences of two love-starved ladies, obviously not quite the same as one another, will interlace. How might they break out from the customary sex characterized jobs relegated to them by society and discover comfort in one another? Will their undercover love at any point discover acknowledgment in a general public where &#8216;sabhyata&#8217; and &#8216;maryada&#8217; mean the world?&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Journalists Jaya Misra and Surabhi Saral, come up short in transforming the excellent theme of &#8216;affection past sex&#8217; into a connecting with story of two ladies discovering comfort in one another.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The focal point of the story is on Astha&#8217;s life and how she is underestimated in her marriage of 11 years. In the first place, she moves from her better half to a theater chief Aijaaz Khan (Imaad Shah). Her affection for him comes from the way that he encourages her to live liberated from her restraints and recognize her cravings, which are overlooked by her family. Yet, ultimately, it is Aijaaz&#8217;s better half Peeplika who &#8216;clicks&#8217; with Astha. Presently, what draws in Astha to Peeplika, why she becomes enamored with her, where does that serious energy come from, we never become more acquainted with.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The show is set in 1992, when the nation saw public mobs. That, nonetheless, stays simply a scenery and never mixes with the story.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Likewise, it is hard to comprehend why a unique and autonomous woman must be displayed as a drunkard and unbridled. Peeplika is demonstrated to be a free, certain woman who grieves by tasting wine for breakfast, lunch and supper, and has easygoing illicit relationships till she discovers love with Astha. When will such threadbare portrayal of an &#8216;autonomous&#8217; woman change?</span>
