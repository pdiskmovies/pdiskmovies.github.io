    <span>There are three account strings driving November Story. In the first, we see the biography of a youngster raised by a cloister adherent who develops into a kid drawn to a medical procedure and later, a man compelled to surrender his fantasy. In the subsequent one, three young people plot the hijacking of a simple-minded young lady (Namita Krishnamurthy) with the assistance of her house keeper. The third one, which takes up the main part of the show&#8217;s time, spins around Anuradha (Tamannaah), a PC master, and her battle with selling a house that has a place with her dad, Ganesan (GM Kumar), a wrongdoing author with second phase of Azheimer&#8217;s.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>One evening, Ganesan gives his overseer the slip and disappears. What&#8217;s more, Anu discovers him in the house that she needs to sell, with a dead lady close by. She attempts to conceal her dad&#8217;s inclusion in the homicide, yet with a cop, Sudalai (Aruldoss) getting dubious, Anu should find the real executioner as quickly as possible for her dad. Everything relies on the date of the wrongdoing &#8211; November 16 &#8211; which additionally is by all accounts have a special interaction, returning to a transport mishap that happened in a Tirunelveli 25 years prior.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>November Story unfurls generally as a whodunit, and essayist chief Indhra Subramanian figures out how to keep us snared with a few probably suspects and distractions to keep us speculating about the genuine killer and the rationale behind the wrongdoing. It is likewise a capability shot show that keeps a steady tone both outwardly (Vidhu Ayyanna is the cinematographer) and account savvy. The creation esteems are very acceptable, and not at all like many shows in the Tamil OTT space, we sense an unmistakable stylish directing the cinematography, creation plan, music and the sound plan. The opportunity that the OTT space offers additionally gives the chief to play with some butchery. Given that some key scenes are set in the funeral home, there is a lot of blood (and surprisingly a stripped body or two), and one vital scene including a pregnant lady isn&#8217;t for the cowardly. Fortunately, the violence doesn&#8217;t feel exaggerated.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Like in a decent wrongdoing novel, Indhra Subramanian continues to take care of us chunks of data in each scene that appear to be associated and gets us to work out the associations even while the account unfurls before our eyes. A portion of the shocks are effectively guessable, similar to the likely killer, and this is to a great extent to projecting. At the point when we see a major name entertainer in a specific job, we right away presume that they may have a bigger impact in the procedures and we are not really astonished when our estimate works out as expected. However, likewise with Sudalai, the chief needs us to zero in additional on the rationale behind the homicide, and here, he figures out how to hold the secret till the end. The way wherein he ties the different account strands together is additionally credible and he prevails with regards to making us ignore the numerous fortuitous events, similar to how the programmer who has broken into the police&#8217;s workers is likewise associated with the killer Anu is after. It is just the last partitions that vibe unnecessarily extended and we get buzzwords like the focal person going isolated to catch the killer, notwithstanding the cops being her ally. The other stumble is the manner by which Sudalai&#8217;s examination unfurls after a point. Maybe than cause him to do the derivation, we get scenes that in a real sense explain the interlinking perspectives in the secret.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In any case, the strong exhibitions help the chief form a generally persuading world. Tamannaah is astonishingly downplayed as a lady who is wrestling with such a large number of issues simultaneously, however the named voice sounds odd, and now and again, removes us from the story. GM Kumar as the maturing wrongdoing author who is bit by bit losing his recollections is great as is Aruldoss, whose cop character really merited a superior conclusion that what he arrives. Then, at that point, there is Pasupathy, who capitalizes on a layered person, and makes him a similarly compassionate and ghastly character.</span>
