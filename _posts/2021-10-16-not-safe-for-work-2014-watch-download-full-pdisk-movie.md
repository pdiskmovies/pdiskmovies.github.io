  <div>
    <span>Why I watched it: It&#8217;s a Netflix pick, right up my alley, thrill ride sort of sounds like a low lease Die Hard.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Arbitrary Thoughts: This is a peculiar movie, delivered by Blumhouse and coordinated by Joe Johnston, he did the primary Captain America, Wolfman, October Sky, he&#8217;s been around yet this is a modest quick in and out, so somewhat bizarre and add to the reality it essentially went right to VOD.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>What I enjoyed: The set up is fine, an assassin comes into what he believes will be a vacant office and isn&#8217;t the only one, he&#8217;s there to kill and obliterate yet a worker who is simply terminated returns and is the fly in the treatment so a mental contest begins. That is fine we&#8217;ve seen it before yet it can in any case work. Some of it is sharp they do a couple of various things with the reason, the worker isn&#8217;t a cop simply an ordinary Joe who&#8217;s attempting to endure utilizing his brains and his insight into the workplace.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Max Minghella is fine as the lead, he&#8217;s affable and savvy, so nothing amiss with him I additionally preferred Eloise Mumford as his colleague love interest to awful she&#8217;s not in the film that much yet they&#8217;re acceptable together and she&#8217;s an amiable screen presence.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film is really short at under 75 minutes so can&#8217;t say anything negative about it being excessively long.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>What I didn&#8217;t Like: This is a tasteless movie and I&#8217;m stunned with Joe Johnston coordinating, to make sure you realize you wouldn&#8217;t know it. I&#8217;m putting it all out there and think they were either time and spending issue or bunches of notes cause it seems as though this film was chopped down and furthermore made like a PG-13, this now and again felt like a TV movie or an awful link movie. This is no frills narrating, they attempt a contort that a visually impaired man could see coming and the primary imperfection is the hired gunman trouble maker is drilling, he&#8217;s not fascinating, or threatening and more plot openings to shake a stick at, the entire plot of why this person is there is truly senseless and by the end has neither rhyme nor reason.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>This feels like a little spending film that just got put together, perhaps eventually they thought this would have been a wicked spine chiller, or an extraordinary activity film yet the cut we got is so tasteless and slight it&#8217;s sort of terrible.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Last Thoughts: Not horrendous however the kind of film that in about fourteen days you will forget you saw it.</span>
