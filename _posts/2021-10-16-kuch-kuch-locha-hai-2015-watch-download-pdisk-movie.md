  <span>PP aka Pravin Patel (Ram Kapoor), a middle-elderly married Gujarati businessman based totally in Malaysia, has a huge overwhelm on Bollywood movie star Shanaya (Sunny Leone). When a contest is introduced about winning a date together with her in Kuala Lumpur, he grabs the opportunity to make his dream (of romancing her) come proper. He then starts offevolved telling lies (lochas) so that you can execute his secret plan.</span>

  <span>Review: You either have a experience of humour otherwise you don’t. If you try too tough to sound humorous, it never works and that’s the case right here. If you prepare done to demise Gujju, Italian and gay human beings stereotypes, you get Kuch Kuch Locha Hai. Also, on the grounds that Sunny Leone and Evelyn Sharma have been roped in, a few extreme skin display is assured. However, notwithstanding the addition of those so-called crowd-pulling tactics, the jaded movie fails to hold you unsleeping, let alone entertain, as it lacks a first rate tale and fails on a couple of grounds. After all, the concept of younger humans dressing up as oldies is no longer funny or possibly works in plays better.</span>

  <span>But the biggest difficulty with KKLH is its genre. While you assume it’s a sex comedy, which become promoted as a own family entertainer, it ends up being neither. Barring the girls slipping into a bikini each&nbsp; mins or flaunting enough cleavage, the movie is in any other case too uninteresting to be a intercourse comedy. Ram Kapoor hams away to glory. Sadly, the movie isn&#8217;t even accidentally funny, besides for this one occasion where Leone says, “Looks toh hai but I am prepared to show expertise.” And she attempts to hone that through figuring out to stay with a Gujju family (Patel’s) to get into the skin of a Gujju person she is set to play. Sigh.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>KKLH is so tedious, inconsequential and lengthy that by using the stop of it, you feel like you’ve spent days and not hours looking it. It’s courageous of the makers to have released it alongside a gem of a film known as Piku!</span>
