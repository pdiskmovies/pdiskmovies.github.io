  <div>
    <span>Kasada Tabara is a hyperlink show composed and coordinated by Chimbu Deven, and created mutually by Venkat Prabhu and R Ravindran under the standards Black Ticket Company and Trident Arts Productions separately. The film has 6 editors, 6 cinematographers and 6 music authors. It is gushing on Sony Liv OTT stage.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Kasada Tabara is a bunch of short movies &#8211; Kavasam, Sadhiyaadal, Thappattam, Pandhayam, Arammpattra, and Akkarai, every one having a different music author, head of photography, and manager. Chief Chimbu Deven is known for testing a great deal and amazing the crowd. This is one such acceptable endeavor.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Kavasam is the primary story that has Premgi and Regina Cassandra in the number one spot jobs. With music by Yuvan Shankar Raja, cinematography by MS Prabhu and altering by Vivek Harshan, the film begins an exceptionally intriguing note. If you can accept the rationale, the film pulls you in directly from the primary edge. The plot advances naturally, and the state of mind of the film will cause you to feel wonderful. Be that as it may, as the short film reaches a conclusion, it leaves you with unanswered inquiries.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It&#8217;s minutes like these that ensure that the film doesn&#8217;t crash and burn and there is some substance actually left and it&#8217;s too soon to abandon the film. The last story having Venkat Prabhu ahead of the pack job experiences screenplay issues and the reason might have been investigated better. Notwithstanding Venkat Prabhu&#8217;s strong acting, the acting is a bit high, and this influences the commitment.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Among different exhibitions, Vijayalakshmi, and Sundeep Kishen stick out and sell their jobs well. The previous looks normal while Sundeep&#8217;s work is noticeable and has deciphered well on screen. The film is in fact solid by and large, however in the music division, Santhosh Narayanan&#8217;s score and voice suffocates you in tenderness. The cinematography of Rajasekhar, Vijay Milton and SR Kathir intrigues the most. By and large, the film draws in you well and attempts to engage you however much as could be expected despite the fact that it&#8217;s anything but a 100% strike rate.</span>
