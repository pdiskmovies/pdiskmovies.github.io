    <span>K Ramachandra (Sharwanand) and S Janaki Devi (Samantha) are secondary school darlings who meet at a get-together following seventeen difficult years. What unfolds next is stuff mixed dreams are made of. C Prem Kumar returns to the now-renowned story of 96 through its Telugu redo Jaanu. Fanatics of the Tamil unique contemplated whether a similar enchantment can even be reproduced briefly time. Film buffs conjectured if Sharwanand and Samantha can repeat the now-notable jobs burned into individuals&#8217; brains by Vijay Sethupathi and Trisha. The genuine answer is both yes and no, Jaanu is no match to 96 but, the film has its own specific manner of sneaking dependent upon you when you wouldn&#8217;t dare hoping anymore worm its direction into your heart.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>K Ramachandra also known as Ram (Sharwanand) is a movement picture taker, a solitary officer and a nonconformist who has developed layers of dividers throughout the long term and framed his own air pocket to live in. At the point when he visits his old neighborhood Visakhapatnam, the dividers start to disintegrate individually as he loves the recollections of his adolescence. A school gathering is called for in Hyderabad and keeping in mind that he&#8217;s glad to meet his cherished companions (Saranya Pradeep, Tagubothu Ramesh, Vennela Kishore), he&#8217;s truly there for his youth darling S Janaki Devi pseudonym Jaanu (Samantha). Furthermore, when the two definitely meet, with the opportunity to put in a couple of hours together in the desire to treatment some profound injuries that actually remain, what unfurls is hard to portray yet something really mysterious.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Jaanu resembles an immense bag loaded with recollections that Ram values. An excursion that launches with a class photograph and finishes right where it starts, aside from leaving two individuals with the conclusion they probably won&#8217;t merit however require. The sentiment among Ram and Jaanu is downplayed at this point clear cut in the most excellent of ways. 10th grader Ram (Sai Kiran Kumar) unexpectedly observes himself to not be able to talk in his companion Jaanu&#8217;s (Gouri G Kishan) presence, an issue that will proceed for quite a long time to come. Jaanu sings like a fantasy (like her namesake) and is unafraid of goading Ram to get what she needs. What&#8217;s more, actually like their sentiment, the explanation they headed out in different directions years prior is additionally so frustratingly straightforward.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>C Prem Kumar doesn&#8217;t reveal to you an original story that will take your breath away because of how out of the world everything is. He&#8217;s a lot more brilliant than that, disclosing to you a story you can genuinely identify with in the most wonderful way. He shows a perhaps when the significant what-uncertainties we as a whole have in life are replied. He shows a fantasy that numerous an individual may dream of. Sharwanand and Samantha convey knockout exhibitions, so do Sai Kiran and Gouri. The more youthful couple don&#8217;t simply adjust the more experienced entertainers yet additionally coordinate to them, which is a sight to see. Sharwanand and Samantha then again live and inhale Ram and Jaanu, reclassifying them in any event, for the individuals who have seen 96. The group of four pulls off scenes with a conviction that is rare.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Prem Kumar isn&#8217;t the sort of chief who will coddle you successions to guarantee there&#8217;s no &#8216;slack&#8217; in the story. He truth be told enjoys each casing of his, capably helped by cinematographer Mahendiran Jayaraju, each second, look and hushes that express more than words do. So a cine-participant expecting the standard figures of speech or account will be left baffled. The discoursed by Mirchi Kiran are acceptable. In any case, could they have been something more? Sure. Aside from the four lead entertainers and the chief, writer Govind Vasantha merits unique notice for uncovering the spirit of Jaanu with his music and BGM. The score of the film is genuinely striking.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Jaanu is a film as agreeable as a case of chocolates, no one can tell what you will get. This isn&#8217;t a vibe decent film since it&#8217;s a lot heftier than that. Heads up in the event that you&#8217;ve at any time ever infatuated, particularly for the exhibitions, the music and simply yield. It&#8217;ll make you grin and cry if nothing else.</span>
