    <span>When a youthful artist leaves on an excursion to make the tune that can rejoin him with his first love and furthermore change the world, things don&#8217;t go very as arranged. As he arrives in a desperate predicament, will music act the hero?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>

    <span>Jai (Ehan Bhat) has just two needs throughout everyday life â€“ his music and his sweetheart Sophie (Edilsy Vargas). While he hasn&#8217;t hit large on the music scene at this point, his rich sweetheart&#8217;s dad Sanjay Singhania (Ranjit Barot) provokes him to create a 100 songs before he can consider wedding Sophie. What&#8217;s more, in this manner starts Jai&#8217;s exhausting excursion that takes him to the delightful and pleasant moving slopes of Shillong, where he has his assignment cut out.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>AR Rahman&#8217;s melodic endeavor is made with adoration and enthusiasm for his craft and that is the one thing that is consistent all through. This is certainly an or more, yet the film&#8217;s general soundtrack is high on amount and much lower on the quality that one would anticipate from a melodic virtuoso like Rahman. All things considered, there is a whole other world to 99 songs than simply its music and some of it sure works, in parts.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>First of all, Debutant Vishwesh Krishnamoorthy explores delicately through the subject, recounting to us a story that maintains its attention on music. The execution and cinematography (Tanay Satam and James Cowley) is distinctly dim and at times feels oppressive, yet many bits stand apart for their striking and innovative visual treatment. The treatment is the thing that gives this film, a profoundly enthusiastic touch that tragically isn&#8217;t so solid in the thinking of itself. The composing might have been really persuading.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Ehan Bhat looks each bit the agonizing performer, profoundly infatuated and his depiction is straightforward. The job gives him adequate room to exhibit his enthusiastic scale and for his first film, Bhat has made a good showing. Debutante Edilsy Vargas played a more troublesome part to just act out without having the option to talk. She looks charming and extreme as Sophie, yet her change isn&#8217;t exceptionally persuading. Additionally, we wish the two youthful entertainers had more scenes between them to flaunt their science, which is critical for a romantic tale like this one. Manisha Koirala and Lisa Ray are very much cast in their separate jobs. Tenzing Dalha as Jai&#8217;s closest companion makes a decent attempt to be cool and relaxed, yet a more prepared person entertainer here would have done marvels.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>By and large, &#8217;99 Songs&#8217; has every one of the components of a passionate romantic tale with music at its center. With better songs and more conviction in its execution, this one had all the possibility to turn into an outline clincher. All things considered, as Manisha Koirala&#8217;s person says, &#8220;Music is the last enduring wizardry on the planet.&#8221;</span>
