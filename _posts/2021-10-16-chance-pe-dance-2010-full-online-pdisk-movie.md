  <span>Sameer is the original struggler who passes on his father in Delhi and comes to Mumbai, pursuing fantasies about turning into a star in Bollywood. Does he figure out how to endure the grim and overwhelming rounds of unlimited tryouts, broken guarantees and botched opportunities?&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Film Review: Begin the count&#8230;.How ordinarily have you seen and heard the tale of the bechara struggler who leaves his old neighborhood with a tooth brush in his rucksack and a pack brimming with dreams that must be satisfied in most extreme city, Mumbai. And afterward, how frequently have you seen him in the long run rise like the Phoenix over a tireless period of battle which makes them be shunted out of maker&#8217;s workplaces, fighting with dismissal slips, crying a pungent tear of desperation on the pungent ocean front or giving himself some pep talk when the going gets truly intense.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Umpteen occasions. What&#8217;s more, that is the place where Ken Ghosh&#8217;s film slips. For, it offers you the same old thing as far as the content which winds up as the most vulnerable connection in this whole show. Unfortunately, it follow every one of the anticipated exciting bends in the road that involve the star-is-conceived story. Indeed, super-capable Sam (Shahid Kapoor) leaves his father (Parikshat Sahni) to sell saris in saddi Dilli, to turn into an entertainer in huge, terrible Bollywood, less a guardian and a terrific daddy. Indeed, he waits for his opportunity making uncultured lungi advertisements and contributing as a messenger kid, trusting the unfilled guarantees of fame may very well materialized. Furthermore, indeed, they do work out as expected, yet solely after a delayed period of battle which goes through the standard pound of craving, a destitute and penniless state.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>However, what makes this film watchable is the enthusiasm that Shahid Kapoor infuses in his depiction of Sam, the struggler with overwhelming joy in his heart. Might be, it&#8217;s the personal strains of the film &#8211; the promotions, the dance school, the tune kid act, the no-back up parent condition &#8211; that stir up the fire in him. Yet, there is a ring of truthfulness and genuineness in his &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m Sameer Behl and this is my number, Sir,&#8217; stuff during the various tryouts that appear to be going no place. Additionally, the connections with the school kids, when he attempts to get by as a dance educator, has a suddenness about it. Once more, perchance pouring out over from his days with Shiamak Davar. The underlying I-disdain kids demeanor is totally brilliant &#8211; and invigorating &#8211; as well. Add to this the foam of Genelia as Tina, the scooty-riding choreographer who thinks from her heart and you have a satisfactory mixture of certain snapshots of fun, fluff and phenomenal continues on the dance floor. In spite of the fact that, we do admit the sound track (Pritam Singh, Adnan Sami, Ken Ghosh, Sandeep Shirodkar) isn&#8217;t a lot to gloat about, considering the film is really conceptualized as a melodic.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The film might not have the enthusiastic remainder of Ishq Vishq, Shahid and Ken&#8217;s first film that set the movies ablaze, yet it has its minutes. A superior prearranged, less unoriginal second half would have without a doubt allowed the film a superior opportunity to astonish and shake</span>.
