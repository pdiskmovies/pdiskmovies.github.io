    <span>A writer battling with his bombed marriage and a mental obstacle lands himself in hot water, after a blackmailer takes steps to uncover his actual character. Simultaneously, he meets an excellent young lady with a dim past. Together, would they be able to defeated their evil presences and live joyfully ever after?&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Audit: Kabir Kapoor (Kunaal Kapoor) is a well known creator and a YouTuber constantly and the rescuer of the world continuously. He masks himself to help those in a tough situation and stop the violations. In any case, his own life is wrecked. His ex (Vidya Malvade), who was undermining him, is currently out to sue him. This in the wake of, pressing him dry with an immense support. She currently needs his &#8216;khatara&#8217; jeep and the rambling cottage in Panchgini, which is additionally the maze of Kabir&#8217;s profound dull mysteries. She even recruits a finesse criminal investigator cum correspondent Ricky Rosario (Karim Hajee) to extort Kabir. In the midst of the entirety of this, a lovely youthful explorer Suhana (Amyra Dastur), in a real sense drops into Kabir&#8217;s life when he is headed to Panchgini. True to form, this possibility meeting quickly forms into affection and live-in, however out of nowhere, a spate of murders rock the lethargic slope station and their lives, as Kabir turns into the fundamental suspect.&nbsp;</span>

      <span>The above is as unmistakably as one can depict, the tangled and bent story that this film is, yet be careful, this is only the start. As essayist chief Amin Hajee lets his imagination and pen free, we&#8217;re assaulted with obscure characters and unexpected developments that continue to get trapped in their own snare of disarray. Amazingly however, Hajee gets going great with interest and obviously, the thing number including a smooth Ellie Avrram enticing a super-smooth Aamir Khan.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The main half develops gradually, demonstrating some guarantee, however the narrative continues to get logically unsteady. The execution remains very disappointing with the story attempting to legitimize its numerous characters and their thought processes. For instance, Kabir&#8217;s tempting maid Bindiya (Neha Mahjan) does just sliding her pallu and sneaking up on her chief. Her commitment to the narrative is nothing, similar as the battery of exciting bends in the road that don&#8217;t make any sense by the same token. More characters are presented directly until the peak, trying to make it a brain drinking spree, however the drowsy speed makes &#8216;Koi Jaane Na,&#8217; a dreary watch. Adding to that, torrent of forgettable melodies, exacerbate the situation.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Kunaal Kapoor and Amyra Dastur are all around cast in their jobs and they have some degree to perform, notwithstanding the undeniable lacunas in the composition. Ashwini Kalsekar is very effective as the extreme cop and Atul Kulkarni is horribly squandered.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Eventually, the most persuading part about this one is its title &#8216;Koi Jaane Na&#8217; that consummately summarizes the inclination in the wake of watching it.</span>
