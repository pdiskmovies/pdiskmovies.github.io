    <span>After a project as a mule driver for a gang is going wrong, Mathan (Tovino Thomas) flees from Tamil Nadu to Kochi and meets together with his former female friend Aparna (Aishwarya), who&#8217;s an aspiring actress. As the duo re-ignite their romance, the cops catch up with him and the duo are forced to make picks of their lives.</span>

    <span>REVIEW: Director Aashiq Abu’s movies have usually pushed the envelope in phrases of content material and presentation in Mollywood. And that’s one of the motives why Mayaanadhi, in spite of the group keeping everything approximately it below wraps, nevertheless controlled to create sufficient anticipation many of the audience. The movie, which stars Tovino Thomas and Aishwarya Lakshmi, is scripted by means of Dileesh Nair and Syam Pushkaran, who is answerable for properly-etched characters of Maheshinte Prathikaaram and Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Much like the ones movies, the 2 lead characters – Mathan (Tovino) and Aparna (Aishwarya) – are the strength of Mayaanadhi. Mathan is a struggling youth. In his latest task as a mule driver transporting money for a gang, those with him are killed in a police come across and he&#8217;s compelled to escape from Kodaikanal to Kochi, but after significantly injuring a policemen.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Aparna is an aspiring actress in Kochi who makes a residing, taking up emcee and modelling assignments in among her auditions, tons to the chagrin of her mom. Mathan meets Aparna, in hopes of rekindling their romance. In parallel, the script introduces three police officers from Tamil Nadu who tries to song down Mathan. How Mathan and Aparna are forced to make picks whilst the police officers track him down forms the rest of the plot of this emotional thriller.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Mayaanadhi begins off gradual, explores an uncommon romance between the duo, after which builds right into a gripping thriller. The scriptwriters deserve due credit score for the way the movie’s characters grow on you. The target market is dealt with to practical times, humour and most of all, real feelings. That’s what makes this a fresh film amid the films that create superficial romances to take the plot forward. Even the kissing and love-making scenes, which are shot aesthetically, have a important implication on the plot, with Aparna telling starry-eyed Mathan, who desires to get married the subsequent morning, that “sex is not a promise”.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>While Aashiq’s preceding movie Rani Padmini had two woman protagonists, the girl attitude in Mayaanadhi is absolutely fresh and empowering. Aishwarya pulls off Aparna with ease, regardless of the person going thru an array of emotions. It doesn’t seem as if it&#8217;s far just her 2nd movie. Both she and Tovino match every different in phrases of performance in a scene where Mathan pleadingly asks if she has at the least a drop of affection for him?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Mathan’s naiveté, the awkwardness after blurting out something offensive and his anticipative look whenever Aparna turns him down are aptly portrayed by Tovino, who should be lauded for taking up the character and making it unique in his own manner.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Jayesh Mohan’s frames keep it actual and some of the scenes, mainly closer to the end are not anything quick of magical. Rex Vijayan’s song complements the movie’s temper. Most of the dialogues earlier than the climax though are in Tamil and in a manner get rid of some of the punch from the denouement.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film has some cameo roles from Soubin Shahir, Lijo Jose Pellissery, Basil Joseph and Aparna Balamurali, all of whom add a dose of shiny spark the film calls for at those degrees. There are a few slow levels within the film, especially in the first half of, but it adds to improvement of its characters.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Aashiq Abu’s Mayaanadhi is a film telling an intense tale of urban characters without any superficiality. It’s additionally a pleasant example on how&nbsp; nicely fleshed out characters can take forward a movie all on their very own. The fresh angle and the poignant denouement in reality make this well worth an eye.</span>
