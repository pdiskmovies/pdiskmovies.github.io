    <span>A younger broking (Mahaakshay) has the arduous task of selling off a haunted house inside the hills. But before he can do this, he chooses to exorcise the house of its shrieking ghosts. More apparently, it method journeying lower back in time to re-align an unsavoury incident that occurred 80 years in the past. Can the broking seal his deal?</span>

    <span>Movie Review: Vikram Bhatt&#8217;s fascination for horror continues, even as the Indian movie industry &#8212; and the desi viewer &#8212; desperately awaits the primary real bone-chiller from Bollywood. Is Haunted the answer to the sit back hunters&#8217; prayers?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Not completely. And it is because the story is dog-eared and carried out-to-loss of life. Almost every horror film has the wailing ghost of a nubile young maiden who sends outs desperate SOSs to all people who dares to go into her area. And don&#8217;t we recognize why she&#8217;s wailing! Still, we might not screen the secret, which in any case, is infrequently a secret&#8230;.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But if the film works &#8212; and it works quite well &#8212; is best due to the special effects of the movie. Experiencing the horror in 3-D is indeed a unique enjoy for the viewer, in particular due to the fact that it is well accomplished. Each time the ghosts lunge out at you, stick out their tongue or flail their limbs, you leap again on your seat. And yes, there are a lot of ghosts, performing a variety of ghastly acrobatics. There&#8217;s even a snake protruding its venom at you and a hurtling brick, almost missing your nostril&#8230;.Great amusing.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Other than that, there may be the scenic beauty (Pravin Bhatt&#8217;s cinematography), a hummable track rating (Chirantan Bhatt) and the attention for detail (the film moves backward and forward in time) which maintains the hours ticking. Performance-sensible, the director has opted for a bunch of recent actors to pitch in as the lead pair. Sadly, there is not anything brilliant about them and they rarely leave an effect. It&#8217;s the veterans, like Achint Kaur and Arif Zakaria who become supplying you with the goosebumps. And they do it in ok measure.</span>
