    <span>Based on the mass clearing of Kashmiri Pandits in 1990, the story follows the existence of youthful love birds, Shiv Kumar Dhar (Aadil Khan) and Shanti Dhar (Sadia), who escape their country and take shelter at a camp in Jammu, with the guarantee that they will get back sometime in the future.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Audit: The setting is late 80s and the public pressure in the beautiful valley of Kashmir is expanding at a disturbing rate as time passes. However, writing devotee Shiv and his compliant and shy spouse Shanti are persuaded that they are protected in the local they have called home throughout recent decades. In any case, as a long time elapse by, the force of inescapable strict brutality outperforms the speculation of the couple and that of thousands of other Kashmiri Pandits, and afterward, they are hit with the terrible mass migration of January 19, 1990. Remaining at the limit of losing all that they at any point had, Shiva and Shanti are presently conflicted between two similarly extreme decisions – save their lives and leave behind their cherished origination or stay back and face the result of a fight against their local area.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In case it&#8217;s not currently clear, Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#8217;s &#8216;Shikara&#8217; is an endeavor to expose the situation of Kashmiri Pandits and their unfavorable strength and fortitude despite misfortune. Remaining consistent with the 90s time and the antagonism predominant during that period, Chopra, efficiently, carries out his verifiable heartfelt dramatization through a guiltless romantic tale between two never-ending hopeful people. Then, at that point, mixes it with the genuine story of steady clash between the Muslim radicals and the Kashmiri Pandits in the valley, ultimately, wrapping it up with the subject he had initially begun with – how unadulterated love can withstand numerous a fight, even of war and slaughter. All through the movie, the essayist chief tosses in different subplots – both genuine and reel – without crashing from the focal subject even once.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Nonetheless, the story is a slight bit all the more outwardly intriguing and artistically captivating in the primary half, as there are various components to keep one speculating concerning what will unfurl. While the subsequent half is more put resources into the romantic tale – which feels outlandish, unsurprising and dated now and again. Likewise, thinking of it as&#8217; an authentic show, it is somewhat disillusioning to observe that the film doesn&#8217;t go past a couple of short lived notices of the trial of individuals from the opposite side of the occurrence; an uneven methodology. Also, a few pieces of the screenplay of &#8216;Shikara&#8217; appear to be very helpful; practically like it was written in flurry to surge back to the topic of sentiment.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Debutants Sadia and Aadil Khan make an alluring pair to watch on screen. Sadia, with her irresistible grin, is a characteristic in segments where she is having the more youthful impact. Aadil&#8217;s portrayal of a beginner writer doesn&#8217;t resound half as much as his depiction of a more established man.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The music and foundation score (A.R Rahman and Sandesh Shandilya) of &#8216;Shikara&#8217; resembles demulcent for the spirit, with capable help from lyricist Irshad Kamil.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>To summarize it, Vindhu Vinod Chopra&#8217;s &#8216;Shikara&#8217; will oblige the realistic sensibilities of a specific segment of the crowd. As a romantic tale, it works at some level, yet in the master plan, this old fashioned sentiment doesn&#8217;t actually hold you and keep you drew in for a really long time.</span>
