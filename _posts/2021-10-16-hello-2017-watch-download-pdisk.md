<span>Avinash/Seenu (Akhil) is a road imp raised by his caring new parents Saru (Ramya Krishnan) and Prakash (Jagapathi Babu). His first love is the young lady he meets during youth Junnu/Priya (Kalyani), whom destiny had grabbed away from him. Fourteen long years they actually hang tight for the day they will meet once more. Will predetermination help them? </span>

<span><br />Hello! Audit: Shah Rukh Khan once said in his hit film &#8216;Om Shanti Om&#8217; &#8211; Kehte hain agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaho &#8230; to puri kainaat usse tumse milane ki koshish mein slack jaati hai. Also, &#8216;Hello&#8217; is a mysterious contextual investigation on the equivalent; how the entire universe contrives to unite two individuals when they&#8217;re intended to be. </span>

<span><br />Avinash/Seenu (Akhil) meets Junnu/Priya (Kalyani) during youth and their adoration is basic and unadulterated. He cherishes how her bangles jingle when she eats paani puri, the chimes on her anklets make a sound as she runs and in particular, he adores her peculiar nature. She adores the way that he has a brilliant heart and how he makes up a tune particularly for her when she inquires. At the point when Junnu&#8217;s dad is moved to Delhi, destiny barbarously isolates them, however as though in repentance, it additionally brings his new parents into his life. Fourteen long years and they&#8217;re both still looking for one another. On the off chance that they at any point observe to be one another or not, is what&#8217;s really going on with &#8216;Hello. </span>

<span><br />&#8216;Hello&#8217; is a film loaded up with magnificence &#8211; be it the entertainers, visuals, love track or even the screenplay. Shockingly, such consideration has been allowed to consistently detail that it makes the film all the seriously staggering. However it&#8217;s somewhat difficult to accept that tree-climbing Seenu grows up to turn into a parkour master Avinash, how about we simply give him the advantage of uncertainty, on the grounds that something else, Akhil is essentially a joy to watch on screen. One can unmistakably see the satisfaction all over when he moves and his grin is basically enlightening. When on screen, he is at this point not the Akkineni ruler, however Seenu, frantic to meet his woman love. </span>

<span><br />Kalyani then again has a class and beauty about her that is difficult to find. Her person, outfits, look and everything has a lovely effortlessness a la Girija in &#8216;Geethanjali&#8217; or Lavanya Tripathi in &#8216;Andala Rakshasi&#8217;. For a debutant, Kalyani has worked effectively for the screen time she was dispensed, which is more in the second half than the first. Akhil and Kalyani just look dazzling together on the screen. </span>

<span><br />Going to the acting experts, Ramya Krishnan and Jagapathi Babu, their characters are more imperative in question than one understands from the beginning. Both the entertainers are tremendous in the jobs, with their characters overflowing with nothing not exactly OTT love for their took on child. While many may feel that the time spent on their person advancement and the reception track is pointless to the story, they are essentially the motivation behind why Anivash could be how he is â€“ the brilliant kid with a brilliant heart. The differentiation is plainly displayed through the personality of Pandu, one more road imp because of whom Seenu&#8217;s life changes twice. Ramya Krishnan and Jagapathi Babu are striking even while exhibiting the day by day complexities of life, be it them stowing away from their child how harmed they are the point at which he continues to address them as aunt and uncle, and surprisingly the delight when he at last calls them amma and nana. </span>

<span><br />Anu Rubens has worked really hard on the soundtrack, with the melodies mixing into the magnificence, all things considered, With all said and done, while Seenu and Junnu&#8217;s romantic tale may be a straightforward one, the film isn&#8217;t. With exciting bends in the road lying round each corner, particularly Seenu in every case low on karma, &#8216;Hello&#8217; has a ton to bring to the table. Try not to expect two part harmonies shot in extraordinary districts or saint rise battle scenes since you will be frustrated. Give this one a watch this end of the week, you will love it!</span>
