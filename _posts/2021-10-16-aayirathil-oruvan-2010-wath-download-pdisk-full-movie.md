  <div>
    <span>When experience meets history with a stewing quarrel pouring out over hundreds of years complete with ages of scorn, is the material of an element film enough? The inquiry drops off the radar, since the film is so captivated between the first and second parts, that it is as though the string is broken, and you are left with various finishes.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Yet, it starts with a bang, and through the hour and a half to the recess, there is definitely not a subsequent where the screenplay wavers, or the content neglects to convey. Anitha Pandian (Reemma Sen) is going a mission, helped by a tactical unexpected, to follow the course taken by 13the Century Chola exiles who escaped, alongside their juvenile sovereign, when fight with the Pandya realm poses a potential threat, and find the safe-house. She is joined by paleontologist Lavanya (Andrea) whose father goes as of late absent while on a similar mission. Going along with them as the top of the group of jacks of all trades is Muthu (Karthi). Astounding circumstances, brilliant repartees, dazzling melody picturisation, all make for an incredible realistic encounter.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The excursion to the hideaway, some place on an island off Vietnam, is full of traps, some laid by the escaping Cholas. The daylight falling on the earth and showing the way is propelled by McKenna&#8217;s Gold. Yet, the speed causes you to fail to remember such correlations. Defeating craving, thirst and sand trap, Lavanya, Anitha and Muthu come to the lost civilisation, however and still, after all that it is difficult. Hallucinations visit them, and they are prepared to remove tissue and devour blood. It isn&#8217;t for the feeble hearted, despite the fact that the film is obviously guaranteed for grown-ups as it were.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The vis-Ã -vis experience with the enduring ruler, played by Parthiban, is terribly hard. And afterward the story flips completely around, when Anitha ends up being a relative of the Pandya realm. To armies of Tamils, who have known a particularly complicated person in Nandini, in Kalki&#8217;s &#8216;Ponniyin Selvan,&#8217; Anitha comes through as a pale second, notwithstanding splendid acting by Reemma.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As a temptress, as a firm group pioneer, in the obnoxious scenes with Lavanya, she is wonderful, and dominates Karthi who holds influence in the primary half. Yet, what is likewise lost is the tight screenplay, and the locations of assault by fighters is obviously a remark on LTTE/Sri Lankan troopers, and very awkward. The drapes descend on a conflict, however numerous unanswered inquiries remain.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Toward the finish of three hours and ten minutes, the chief doesn&#8217;t respond to the fundamental question set off by the title: Who is this man, who is one out of many? In contrast to the previous film (Mgr&#8217;s) with a similar title, the normal movie attendee may not discover the end decisive. Might be that clarifies the &#8216;thodarum&#8217; toward the end- &#8211; an obvious guarantee of a spin-off. In that lies the issue with AO. The excursion will proceed, however whither?</span>
