    <span>At the point when one of her patients dies Dr. Syd Ludwick (Lisa Hartman &#8211; Roses Are for the Rich) chooses she needs a break from medical clinic and her kind of beau Tom (Ken Land), so she goes on an outing to her hometown of Bloomfield for a secondary school gathering. However, getting back works up memories and sharpness as things among Syd and he mother Helen (Rue McClanahan &#8211; Generation Gap) have not been acceptable since her dad died. Be that as it may, possibly getting back will bring some euphoria as her one genuine affection, Gus (Dale Midkiff &#8211; Torn Apart), actually lives there with his child Jake (Blake Woodruff).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Presently it must be said that &#8220;Back to You and Me&#8221; is perhaps the most unsurprising TV movie I have come across and I have observed in excess of a couple. From the moment Syd gets back to Bloomfield all that which happens is truly signposted. There is the stressed relationship which Syd has with her mom since the time her dad kicked the bucket, there is Syd&#8217;s first love of her life, Gus, who lives around with his child Jake who incidentally turns out to be debilitated and there is Connie who feels weak at the knees over Gus. You know before the finish of the film Syd and her mom will have arranged their disparities, Syd will end up back in affection with Gus while Connie attempts to stamp her territory with him and obviously being a doctor Syd will help Gus&#8217; child Jake. It is no spoiler for me to have told you any of this in light of the fact that &#8220;Back to You and Me&#8221; is that everyday practice.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Be that as it may, being clear isn&#8217;t an issue since it means you can simply pause for a moment and be engaged by the enchanting dramatization. You can be charmed by the great characters who live in Bloomfield, for example, Ed who while at school was the agitator however presently is a Church serve and a bit of a go between. There is the unpretentious sentiments among Syd and Gus which actually thunder along worked out through little looks and sweet moments, for example, when Gus drives Syd up to their old mystery place by the lake. And while there are two or three moments of minor dramatization, and I do mean minor, they wind up adding to the appeal and feel nice sentiment of &#8220;Back to You and Me&#8221;. Indeed it is all ridiculous yet it is so charming and endearing that you couldn&#8217;t care less.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>And the motivation behind why you don&#8217;t mind is a direct result of the splendid projecting of the focal characters as well as the supporting ones. Barbara Niven, Larry Manetti, Joel McCrary, Don Harvey and Rue McClanahan all add a smidgen of unassuming community humor to procedures which you realize will make you grin at whatever point they are in a scene. And then, at that point there is Lisa Hartman and Dale Midkiff as Syd and Gus who have this truly delightful energy going on, less a flash of sentiment, however this delicate feeling which introduces itself through a grin when they see one another or the reality they can&#8217;t remove their eyes from one another.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>What this all reduces to is that &#8220;Back to You and Me&#8221; decides to be a basic, beguiling, feel great heartfelt dramatization and it accomplishes all that it decides to do.</span>
