    <span>At the point when more-than-enjoyably stout Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar) gets hitched to Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana), the last can&#8217;t force himself to look past his significant other&#8217;s size. Her constant endeavors to prevail upon his consideration are to no end and the two end up near the precarious edge of separation when she catches him passing questionable comments about her to companions. Can lard block love?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <div>
      <span>Review: Dum Laga Ke Haisha is an unlikely semi unique contribution from the steady that in ongoing past has put forth genuine attempts to oppose the customary thoughts of adoration.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>This film may encourage the reason for splitting away from the stronghold however it stinks of consistency. Sharat Kataria pulls off an interesting yet-imperfect film. Set in around 1995 in Haridwar, he cautiously abstains from making a staple, sweet undertaking. The film&#8217;s first hour cruises easily sans hiccups, yet the subsequent half can be blamed for unspooling monotonously.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>The film raises a plot whose on-the-face wistfulness factor is practically jostling. Its provincial setting, clamoring by-paths and old-world appeal makes a clear showing of selling the VCR time. There&#8217;s even a frantically included battle grouping where the couple forcefully play 90s melodies.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>Such scenes may make you laugh uncontrollably, however the popping impact is cleared out as the film moves towards an anticipated peak including Kumar Sanu, a consistent installation since the principal scene. It&#8217;s the lone thing that makes its &#8216;failure&#8217; saint look great and is a devised summit of the sentiment we never discover blossoming.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>The film&#8217;s subplots are superfluous and unexpected, like the abrupt destruction of a never-referenced uncle which triggers the last venture.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>The entertainers, nonetheless, convey recovering exhibitions. For a debutante, Pednekar is shockingly sure. Khurrana, is the best he has been since his dispatch adventure. Sanjay Mishra and Seema Pahwa are in their prime.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>In any case, eventually, it isn&#8217;t unprecedented, neglecting to transcend the possibility that a hefty young lady needs some schmuck to finish her life. Obviously, the smarts are apparent in its unique reasoning however it doesn&#8217;t convert into a satisfying survey insight.</span>
