  <span>In the destitution stricken favelas of Rio de Janeiro during the 1970s, two young fellows pick different ways. Rocket (Phellipe Haagensen) is a growing picture taker who records the increasing medication related brutality of his area. José &#8220;Zé&#8221; Pequeno (Douglas Silva) is an eager street pharmacist who uses Rocket and his photographs as an approach to increase his acclaim as a turf war ejects with his adversary, &#8220;Knockout Ned&#8221; (Leandro Firmino da Hora). The film was shot on the spot in Rio&#8217;s poorest areas.</span>
