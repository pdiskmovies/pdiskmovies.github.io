    <span>Given Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s bright public behavior and continuing legitimate difficulties, playing a stripper with a crackhead mother might not have been the most ideal approach to distract from her tabloid image. Luckily, in the bloody psychological thriller &#8220;I Know Who Killed Me,&#8221; Ms. Lohan additionally plays an affluent understudy who writes fiction, dominates at the piano and won&#8217;t lay down with her boyfriend. That is good, then, at that point.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As the understudy, Aubrey Fleming, Ms. Lohan wears serious glasses and lean, dark hair. She taps on her PC and tickles the ivories while her folks (Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough) watch affectionately and her boyfriend, Jerrod (Brian Geraghty), slobbers uninvolved. As the stripper, Dakota Moss, Ms. Lohan displays Daisy Dukes and a radiant bra, fun twists and stage boots. She allures a shaft and does dreadful things with her customers&#8217; cigarettes. No prizes for guessing which execution is more believable.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>However, the two characters are significantly more credible than the plot, a rococo mix of cut off limbs, common stigmata and prostheses doubling as ceiling ornaments. A serial killer is stalking the princely suburb of New Salem, and when Aubrey disappears just to appear some time later minus her memory and a few peripheral body parts, the F.B.I. assumes the killer will get back to finish the work. Meanwhile Aubrey is claiming to be Dakota; and however everybody presumes injury, Jerrod is only appreciative of his girlfriend&#8217;s settled for less and increased flexibility.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>For Ms. Lohan, it&#8217;s far down from Robert Altman to Chris Sivertson, a director whose creativity is in direct proportion to the quantity of shafts in a particular shot. He and his writer, Jeffrey Hammond, additionally display a peculiar fetish for blue, peppering the plot with sky blue roses and periwinkle surgical gloves at customary intervals. (I half anticipated that the killer should be uncovered as a dismissed member of Blue Man Group.) The film does, nonetheless, offer the intriguing image of Ms. Lohan trying to stitch herself back together â€” a scene simply begging for a metaphorical reading.</span>
