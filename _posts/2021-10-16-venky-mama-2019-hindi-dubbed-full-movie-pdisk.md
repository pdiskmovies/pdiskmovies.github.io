    <span>Venky Mama Review: How regularly have we seen a &#8216;family show&#8217; with a passionate connection, an unstable romantic tale and a couple of detestable folks tossed into a blend just so the saint can utilize his muscles? Chief KS Ravindra also known as Bobby&#8217;s most recent potboiler, Venky Mama follows a comparable example. The film is by all accounts caught in a time where producers can&#8217;t think past the standard thing &#8216;tune battle feeling&#8217; recipe, and the outcome is a ludicrous, sensational sham.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Venkata Ratnam also known as Military Naidu (Venkatesh) loses his sister and her better half in a fender bender and chooses to raise his stranded nephew Karthik (Naga Chaitanya) as his own kid. The team become indivisible, to such an extent that Karthik rejects open positions in London so he can remain with his mama, and Venkata Ratnam stays an unhitched male since ladies don&#8217;t adore his nephew the manner in which he does. They additionally set each other up with ladies utilizing ridiculous, adolescent strategies, which mysteriously appear to work. Nonetheless, there are detestable powers at play (read horoscope) that attempts to separate this mama-alludu combo. However, will they prevail with regards to keeping them separated?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In most Tollywood family shows, producers will in general pester about the passionate condition between a dad and child. In this film, it&#8217;s the mama-alludu combo that goes to the front. Thankfully, the chief extras us the wretchedness of a battle between the two and a passionate fix up. In any case, he peppers the film with sensational scenes that show how much both of them care for one another. Picture this, Karthik says a final farewell to his better half Harika (Raashi Khanna) on the grounds that he decides to remain with his mama as opposed to going to London. In any case, when Harika goes to their town to see both of them together, it&#8217;s the ideal opportunity for waterworks &#8211; she promptly understands her indiscretion and both of them get together. Then again, Venkata Ratnam won&#8217;t wed on the grounds that no lady appears to be agreeable in tolerating a youngster alongside wedding him. At the point when Karthik looks into this, he chooses to set him up with a Hindi instructor (Payal Rajput). Yet, test this, the first occasion when he meets her, he hurries to her and inquires as to whether she&#8217;s hitched or single. In case that is not silly enough, the following moment, he&#8217;s driving her and her dad home, telling rough wisecracks regarding how he&#8217;s going to &#8216;set her up&#8217;. The humor in the film is absolutely coarse, and not briefly does it by any chance power a laugh out of you. The Kashmir track is similarly adolescent and save for the shocking areas, there&#8217;s nothing truly pulling out all the stops.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The main redeeming quality for Venky Mama is the exhibition of its lead entertainers Venkatesh and Naga Chaitanya. Venky, specifically is quiet and pros the job of the hovering uncle. Neither Raashi or Payal get any degree to perform, and are regularly sidelined because of ineffectively composed characters. Prakash Raj also shows up in a matter of seconds and-miss job and scarcely has an effect.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The best issue with Venky Mama is its composition. Dull and average â€” it neglects to go past an attempted and tried recipe. The mama-alludu relationship is played up, they give their relationship and crystal gazing turn to cause it to appear as though they&#8217;re at serious risk. There&#8217;s a town setting, &#8216;cos it&#8217;s a family dramatization. There&#8217;s a malicious MLA with a band of hooligans, &#8216;cos the saints need to utilize their muscles. Two ladies are added in with the general mish-mash for an adoration track (and melodies, obviously). There&#8217;s even an arbitrary plot happening some place in Kashmir, which obviously, has neither rhyme nor reason. The tunes battles opinion recipe might have worked before, yet with content continually developing, as a watcher, you need more than this.</span>
