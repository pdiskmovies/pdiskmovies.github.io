    <span>An honest police officer and a small-time conman come to be crossing paths at a time while the two are in dire need of cash. When greater characters enter the scene, confusion and chaos ensues.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>There have been some films that revolve across the problem of demonetization in Kannada. Unfortunately, none of these managed to go away an impact. Debutant director Radhakrishna Reddy has woven a amusing comic mystery that makes use of this very challenge as the premise, and it ends up being a amusing watch.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>One of the plus points of the film is its set of oddball characters, every going through a private disaster. The narrative woven around the desires of these human beings and the following roadblocks they face makes for a fun experience. The humour is diffused and leaves you giggling. The casting is quite plenty spot on.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Achyuth Kumar leads the appearing honours. He receives a script that he has the responsibility of shouldering and he stands tall. Raj B Shetty is in exceptional shape and impresses with his impeccable comedian timing. Vasishta N Simha and Chaitra Rao as the younger couple in love depart an affect. Veterans Prakash Raj and Sadhu Kokila deliver as predicted. An unusual wonder cameo from Huccha Venkat is some other spotlight.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film is technically sturdy in phrases of the screenplay, cinematography and background score. The first half is a breezy watch, at the same time as the emotional content material within the 2nd 1/2 does gradual the tempo a tad bit. Though, Mayabazar 2016 is clearly one of the higher comedies that has come out nowadays and it&#8217;s far nicely really worth a journey to the cinema corridor.</span>
