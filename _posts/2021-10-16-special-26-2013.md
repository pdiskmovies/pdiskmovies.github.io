<div>
  <div>
    <span>Prepared for a phony &#8216;Foursome&#8217;, with some &#8216;genuine&#8217; stuff. Here it goes. With cool conmen, cops, pursues, psyche, matter and maal. On the whole, meet the individuals from the con-club. The asli khiladi Ajay (Akshay), sharp, trying and solid willed &#8211; he&#8217;s the expert organizer. Sharmaji (Kher), a small piece powerless hearted, yet the genuine &#8216;flank of Punjab&#8217; (with 8 bachchas and pressing onward). Add in, Iqbal (Kishore Kadam) and Joginder (Rajesh Sharma) – who add muscle to the driving force. In the last part of the 1980&#8217;s these conmen act like CBI officials and attack malaamal matris, business magnates and gem specialists.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Without any records or FIRs – they escape after each heist with a spotless (white) inner voice and heaps of dark cash. A (genuine) CBI overseer, Waseem (Manoj) alongside sub-monitor Ranveer (Jimmy) get on a lethal pursue to seize them while they&#8217;re faking it. All things considered, in the event that you need to sort out con-asli, con-nakli, go on, wear Sherlock&#8217;s (Holmes) suit and break this one.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>With a shrewdly layered job and a splendid demonstration, Anupam Kher genuinely &#8216;gets everyone&#8217;s attention. Akshay hits hard, with unadulterated, unadulterated acting, less activity. Manoj is consistently in order, red hot and fabulous. Jimmy loans solid help; Kajal Aggarwal (Ajay&#8217;s affection interest) streaks grins in breaks, and Divya Dutta tosses in snickers.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Motivated by a genuine occurrence, Neeraj Pandey slices to the chor-police pursue and weaves a clever, mind-dashing thrill ride, keeping you firmly tied to your seats. It catches the 80&#8217;s period delightfully; and the cinematography (Bobby Singh) is notably better than (special notice: scenes in Connaught Place, Delhi, and Kolkata roads). The amazing foundation score enthuses the speed. The solitary spot he loses force is the heartfelt track and dance number, somewhat ridiculous, we should say.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Strangely, this con-work story isn&#8217;t amazingly beautiful or covertly genuine. It doesn&#8217;t stagger you with a social message like Pandey&#8217;s &#8216;A Wednesday&#8217;, yet it grasps, invigorates and ahh&#8230;climaxes as well! What&#8217;s more, no &#8230; you can&#8217;t phony this one! Catch it for unadulterated true to life climax.</span>
