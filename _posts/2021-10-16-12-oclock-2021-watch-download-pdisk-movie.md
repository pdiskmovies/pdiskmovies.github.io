<div>
  <span>The tale revolves round a younger woman, Gauri, who&#8217;s traumatised by way of the frequent nightmares she reviews on a everyday foundation, which frequently leads to sleepwalking.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>REVIEW: The initial scenes country that random people are becoming killed in Mumbai and there is some serial killer in the back of those heinous crimes. With no ties among the murders, soon sufficient the point of interest shifts to a school female Gauri (Krishna Gautam), who has all at once become aloof and long gone quiet. Gauri begins having these nightmares or even starts sleepwalking, but her family members are unaware of these incidents. However, the current changes in her behaviour clutch absolutely everyone&#8217;s attention, in particular her loved ones and a nosy neighbour. Are these signs and symptoms of pre-examination stress? Or there may be something else this is bothering this little woman forms the crux of the story.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>With fairly appropriate actors and a story that had the cloth to turn into some thing notable, director-author Ram Gopal Varma presents a 1/2-baked broth of some below-developed characters and the now not-so-convincing subplots (as an instance, the equation among Gauri and her boyfriend, and that of Francis (Manav Kaul) and his wife (Flora Saini) – is difficult). In the primary half one receives bored looking to determine out what is wrong with the lead individual. Eventually, the latter element continues you hooked especially while the new characters—Mithun Chakraborty as a psychiatrist, Debholay, and Manav Kaul as come upon professional, Francis Desouza—are added. Overall, it’s a half-hearted attempt from RGV who has previously directed horror movies including ‘Bhoot’, ‘Phoonk’ and ‘Vastu Shastra’.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Barring a scene, where you see Gauri suddenly waking up within the midnight and in the subsequent element in which she turns her neck, the rest of it just fails to ship shivers down your backbone. With no predominant jump scares, the film receives tedious and the period (112 mins) seems never-ending. However, the history score by means of MM Keeravani (of Baahubali reputation) and Amol Rathod’s cinematography is impactful in giving some backbone-chilling moments on the way to surely preserve one at the brink in their seats.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Coming to the performances, debutante Krishna Gautam is convincing as Gauri but lacks conviction as a possessed youngster. Mithun Chakraborty and Manav Kaul help in pushing the narrative ahead. Makrand Deshpande as Gauri’s involved and helpless father offers a decent overall performance, too. Though his act was a piece off inside the emotional scenes, in particular whilst he is visible dropping tears on display.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>If you get spooked effortlessly, you can not mind this one. However, as a mental thriller this is focussed on ‘one’s believes in supernatural activities handiest once they have confronted themselves’, ’12 ‘o&#8217; Clock’ fails to maintain your attention for too lengthy and finally ends up being a bit of a drag.</span>
