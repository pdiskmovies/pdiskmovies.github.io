    <span>An illiterate road boy has only one ambition – to fly kites and reign very best inside the blue skies. And he&#8217;s going to flip around everything in his small international to string his dream collectively.</span>

    <span>Movie Review: So meet Gattu (Mohammad). A common avenue kid. Dreaming of flying sky-excessive. But no supersonic jets or choppers in his desires actually. Like the famous seagull known as Jonathon Livingston, who simplest desired to fly higher and better, what this terrible, illiterate boy (living in small-city Roorkee) lives for, is a string, a brightly coloured, diamond fashioned patang. And of course, a few breeze to boost his spirits and help his kite jump. The simplest riding force in his measly life (living underneath an open roof, with tin drums for walls, and bizarre-jobs for a paltry sum of Rs.20 a day) is his knack for flying kites. Even his chachu’s (Naresh Kumar), at instances, harsh and tyrannical pressures to paintings for a living don’t suppress his blithe spirit. In fact, with some cutely devilish developments, effervescent strength and glowing eyes, Gattu is a sweet soul, continually sunwashed with wish. He has only one problem – Kali! A mysterious black patang (believed to do patang ka jaadu-tona), who has for many years, defeated all other kites in town, and nobody is aware of who&#8217;s her master. Our Mr. Smarty Half-pants who thinks on his feet, realizes that the simplest manner to conquer Kali is to fly his kite from the very best point, that is the nearby school terrace. And he pulls all ‘strings’, literally, to take on the ‘black diamond’ in the blue skies. Even if it way sneaking into college, pretending to be ‘Agent Gattu’, disguised as a pupil, mendacity to chachu, developing a web of innovative testimonies and antics (of wafadar jasoos, aatankvadis, and barood) that leaves everyone convinced, charmed and pressured on the same time. Rightly, a thoughts of a child is certainly magical; all they want is sand to make a fortress. Or a hand-made kite to keep the sector.</span>

    <span>Mohammad Samad’s overall performance is coronary heart-warming, with marvel in his eyes and playful innocence he grabs all of your attention. His confined world suddenly opens doorways, and as he receives lessons on gravity and goodness, technology and sach ji jeet, his big eyes twinkle with amazement – like he’s just noticed ET on Earth.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Naresh Kumar plays his element properly, as the austere chachu harrowed by means of Gattu’s guts, who eventually melts and embraces him.</span>

  <div>
    <span>Director Rajan Khosa has intelligently made a children’s film (which has been applauded inside the competition circuit) that actually crosses all age boundaries. It subtly throws light on compelling problems like baby illiteracy and child labour with out shouting from terrace-tops or turning into a preachy docu-drama. In one second the tale is solely simple, and within the other it’s profound enough to transport you, if now not theatrically surprise you. It’s greased with a kind of paradoxical truth, yet, it leaves you upbeat.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Gattu is a have to-look ahead to kids of every age (study: grown-united states of americaeven greater). And if you assume you’re too grown up for a kiddie movie, pass fly a kite. Maybe it&#8217;s the real problem with the arena, too many humans grow up too soon. We need to just let the babies in us rule the arena.</span>
