  <span>On the nighttime of Nov. 15, 1864, Union Lt. Col. Charles Fessenden Morse sat on the roof of a residence and watched Atlanta burn. It become a “dazzling and lousy spectacle,” he wrote later to his brother Robert. “For miles across the united states of america was as light as day, … the flames shooting up for hundreds of toes into the air.” Earlier, over the roar and crackle of the flames, Morse had heard the thirty third Massachusetts band serenade Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who ordered the city torched. “It became like fiddling over the burning of Rome.” The next morning, not anything turned into left of the city “besides its church buildings the town corridor and the personal dwellings. You should infrequently find a vestige of the once terrific R.R. Depots, warehouses, &c. It was melancholy,” Morse lamented, “however it changed into warfare, prosecuted in lethal earnest.”</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Morse, an officer in the Second Massachusetts, had volunteered for the Union warfare effort at the first opportunity in April 1861. He and his comrades fought within the Eastern Theater from 1861 to 1863; Morse became promoted to captain in Company B and, after Gettysburg, to lieutenant colonel. He and his men then took trains to Tennessee and served underneath Henry Slocum in Sherman’s Georgia campaign.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>When he arrived on its outskirts within the summer of 1864, Atlanta became intact. Morse yearned to peer “that devoted town,” whose “spires and towers [rose] in undeniable sight above the eternal forests” of northern Georgia. He participated inside the siege and watched the lit fuses of shells as they arced over Union camps and disappeared into the city’s streets, exploding and kindling massive fires. During the battles for Atlanta that fall, Morse had a couple of close calls. “One shell burst inside ten toes of me throwing me flat by its concussion and protecting me with dirt,” he told Robert. And once more, “at the same time as I turned into looking to devour a bit breakfast a shot struck the board which my plate changed into on and sent things flying.”</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>When Atlanta finally fell on Sept. 2, Morse had an possibility to examine the wreckage. Most of the homes had been abandoned and some have been burned by way of taking flight Confederates trying to maintain conflict matériel out of Union arms. “Our shells destroyed a superb deal of assets,” Morse noted. “I am sorry now that a single one became thrown into the town. I don’t think it hastened the surrender by means of a day, it did no damage to the rebellion navy, the simplest casualties being twenty innocent old guys, girls, and youngsters, and two squaddies. There are variations of opinion approximately this sort of conflict, however I don’t love it.”</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Morse’s evaluation of siege battle and his emotions of regret had been not unusual in Union camps in 1864. On the only hand, towns performed a vital function in both Union and Confederate navy techniques. It changed into not sufficient to have the most powerful or largest military in the subject; one have to take the enemy’s facilities of production and politics as nicely. And under the mounted laws of struggle, towns have been valid navy goals.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>On the alternative hand, the presence of noncombatants within them complex the ethical calculus of bombardment. In the discussions about “civilized war” that circulated at some point of the Civil War, conducting acts of destruction hurtful to “girls, kids, unwell, wounded, and elderly” become disreputable at best and the work of what Southerners known as “the Vandal horde” at worst. Morse vacillated in this problem however ultimately embraced the maximum commonplace protection of siege and tough battle processes: navy necessity.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>In early November, Union Col. William Cogswell, who have been “ordered to prepare this location for destruction,” gave Morse — a trained architect who had studied engineering at Harvard earlier than the war — “fee of approximately 1/2 of it.” Morse submitted a proposal for how to raze the metropolis; he and his men could “mine and blow up two depots larger and finer than any in Boston … [we] also shall blow up some solid stone round houses, freight homes, chimneys &c. The relaxation of the destruction could be through fireplace– … For as a minimum&nbsp; miles along the railroad the homes are almost continuous. The warehouses cowl at the least 5 acres so you see there can be quite a hearth.” Morse changed into happy with his proposed method. “This is new commercial enterprise for me,” he admitted to Robert, “but I accept as true with I actually have made a wonderfully viable plan for it.”</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Morse sat up on that roof until the early morning hours of Nov. Sixteen watching the “grand show” that reduced Atlanta to a metropolis “of no extra importance than the maximum insignificant city in Georgia.” Then he clambered down, accumulated his men and marched out of the town in the direction of Decatur. As he did, he grew to become his again at the smoking ruins of Atlanta, cloth reminders of the significance of urban areas to military approach, and of conflict prosecuted in deadly earnest.</span>
