    <span>Supercop ACP Yashvardhan (John Abraham) thinks his energy lies within the reality that he&#8217;s a loner, subsequently he can move all out against the drug mafia and not using a fear. But matters alternate while he falls in love with the vivacious Maya (Genelia D&#8217;souza) within the middle of a tough undertaking wherein he should take care of a fierce opponent (Vidyut Jamwal), hungry for revenge. Will love grow to be his weak spot or can the hard cop keep on his venture, undeterred?</span>

    <span>Movie Review: A remake of the 2003 Tamil blockbuster Kaakha Kaakha, Force is a heady cocktail of excessive powered motion and breezy romance that make certain there may be by no means a dull moment. Director Nishikant Kamat too goes the Rohit Shetty-Abhinav Kashyap (Singham-Dabangg) manner and attempts to create an old fashioned motion film which sticks to the tried-and-examined system of pitching the hero towards the villain in umpteen excessive testosterone sequences of pure mara-mari. And for punctuation, there are the romantic interludes where the macho superhero, awkward with emotions, attempts his high-quality to forge a unusual new courting which needs a totally new ardour from him: one which has not anything to do with battering heads and smashing cars.</span>

    <span>But good day, it&#8217;s the age of serenading the antique, isn&#8217;t always it and unfashionable is sincerely in vogue. Also, the truth that Force showcases some incredible craftsmanship, both in its motion and emotional sequences and has a 2nd half of that literally hurtles at a frenetic tempo, guarantees which you by no means become bored within the onscreen complaints. Things to experience: oddballs John and Genelia attempting to find a not unusual meeting factor, with Genelia overtly asserting she wants to make like to the hunky cop, the cop quartet that tirelessly wages a warfare towards the drug cartel, the combat sequences shot with art and finesse by means of Ayanankar Bose, the excessive emotional quotient in an out and out movement movie&#8230;.And yes, how are we able to overlook this: John Abraham&#8217;s pure beefcake attraction.</span>
