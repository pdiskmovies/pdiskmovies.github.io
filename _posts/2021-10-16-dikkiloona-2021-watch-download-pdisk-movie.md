    <span>At one point or the opposite, we&#8217;d have all questioned how our lives might be better if we may want to pass back in time and do certain matters differently. That is what Mani (Santhanam) feels whilst he stumbles across a time system. He has been unable to recognise him dream of turning into a hockey participant. And he hates his present job, as a worker within the strength board. Worse, his married life — with Priya (Anagha), the girl of his desires — is at the rocks.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>So, inside the yr 2027, while he stumbles into his friend Albert (Yogi Babu), who&#8217;s a part of a mystery organization of scientists seeking to invent a time gadget, he jumps on the risk whilst the system surely starts working. He goes again to 2020, to the day of his marriage, to try to prevent it, now not realising that this pass is going to mess up his existence even further.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Karthik Yogi, the director of Dikkiloona, in reality has the ingredients for a madcap entertainer. There is the complexity of time travel, with different timelines; there are a gaggle of screwball characters — a couple of bumbling time cops, a mental asylum with its eccentric patients and health practitioner&#8230; But more than comedy, what we get is romantic drama that also has some comedy. This wouldn&#8217;t were an issue if the lady leads have been written well and the romance presented in a way to make us care. But right here, each the heroines are written in a superficial manner. Neither Priya nor Meghna (Shirin Kanchwala) come upon as fully fleshed-out characters, with their moves being portrayed as henpecking or as acting like a spoilt baby. It does not help that we get traces which might be chauvinistic.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But the comic quantities paintings — to an volume. Santhanam does his standard insult comedy (Chithra Lakshmanan is all over again a target) and rhyming jokes, however, by using now, we&#8217;re so familiar with those that what might have once generated laughs leaves us only with a grin. Still, there are some moments when he surely makes us guffaw &#8211; like in a scene wherein he compares himself to Amala Paul in Aadai. The supporting comedians, specifically Anandaraj, Munishkanth and Lollu Sabha Maran, are a laugh.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It is these scenes that rescue the film and make us marvel if this cloth might have labored better if the director had selected to make it as an out-and-out comedy. In its present state, it&#8217;s far simply diverting fare which you overlook once it ends.</span>
