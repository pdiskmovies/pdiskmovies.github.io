    <span>There are two essential changes that promptly distinguish Netflix&#8217;s He&#8217;s All That from the film on which it&#8217;s based, the 1999 adolescent romantic comedy She&#8217;s All That: It&#8217;s sexual orientation swapped and Gen Z-driven. However, the new movie, coordinated by Mean Girls helmer Mark Waters, fails to utilize either of those alterations — nor does it hold even the slightest charms of its predecessor.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The two movies are secondary school-set Pygmalion adaptations; the broadly dearest unique stars Freddie Prinze Jr. as the well known athlete who takes a bet to make a prom sovereign out of a craftsmanship nerd (Rachael Leigh Cook, in her breakout job). The new film&#8217;s most obvious endeavor at an update — and eventually its biggest mistake — is to cast TikTok star Addison Rae in the master job, presently a delight force to be reckoned with named Padgett Sawyer instead of Prinze&#8217;s soccer star Zack Siler. When her hacky pop star sweetheart (Peyton Meyer) humiliates her on a livestream, Padgett goes viral &#8220;in the incorrect way,&#8221; losing thousands of followers and consequently her sponsorship with a cosmetics brand (getting terminated by a wonder head honcho played by Kourtney Kardashian).&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Since &#8220;makeovers are my thing,&#8221; all things considered, Padgett makes a bet with one of her friends (Madison Pettis and Myra Molloy are among the film&#8217;s brightish spots as Padgett&#8217;s BFFs, a coterie rounded out in 1999 by Paul Walker and Dulé Hill): She&#8217;ll transform a complete dweeb into the following prom lord, thus winning back her followers and sponsorship. Because, we are relied upon to accept, the politics of the hilariously named Cali High School are somehow convincing enough to draw in hundreds of thousands of young consumers&#8217; riveted consideration. However I guess following the efforts of a lot of girls desperate to be instilled into shabby campus cults has obviously turned into a frenzy as well, so what do I know?</span>
