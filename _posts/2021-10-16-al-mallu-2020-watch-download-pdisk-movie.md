    <span>Nayana was cheated by her forthcoming fiancee, however when he does likewise to a dear companion, she concludes that&#8217;s it&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Survey: The least you can expect in a Boban Samuel film is to enjoy a couple of chuckles, regardless of whether the plot may be a bit fantastic. The chief wanderers into a genuine region with Al Mallu, which is set in the Middle East, however with not extraordinary outcomes.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Namitha Pramod plays Nayana, who is a supervisor lady at a firm. A Casanova-type named Tom, played by Anoop, has his eyes on her, and keeping in mind that she opposes from the outset, the family reaches out and she consents to the match. Be that as it may, Tom is looking for trouble and in the wake of giving a stunt a shot her, she severs and separates. However, it is only the start of a weakly prearranged plot.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>She returns to work and is furtively supported on her feet by new partner, Sreekumar, played by an extremely, wooden Fariz; he scarcely figures out how to let out a grin, not to mention show some other feeling on screen.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film is just 128 minutes, yet feels ceaseless. While Namitha Pramod plays the central person and has done as such easily in prior films, she appears without her usual energy in this one. Miya has pretty much 10 minutes of screen time, however she is her usual vivacious self. Dharmajan and Siddique show their experience on screen and are alright in their parts.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The music by Ranjin Raj isn&#8217;t awful. However, it&#8217;s not satisfactory why the film is set in the Middle East. Is it to show the depression of youthful grown-ups there?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film attempts to give an illustration on morality and the various eyes through what men are ladies are seen on the moral range, yet the plot is tossed with pointless stories and needs center.</span>
