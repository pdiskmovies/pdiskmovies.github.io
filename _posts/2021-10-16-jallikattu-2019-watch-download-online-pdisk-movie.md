  <div>
    <span>Confusion results when Varkey&#8217;s butcher bison goes crazy into the middle of a town. What follows is a story of wounded monsters and inner selves.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Audit : Anyone who has watched Lijo Jose Pellissery&#8217;s Angamali Diaries knows what this current man&#8217;s control is over crowd commotion. Be that as it may, Jallikettu is a few scores up. It demonstrates that Lijo Jose Pellissery is the &#8216;lord of bedlam&#8217;. Jallikettu is really monster versus creature, and it is dependent upon you, the watcher, to conclude who will be who.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>A bison goes crazy before the butcher Varkeychan (Chemban Vinod) could butcher it, making the whole town slip into a reformist commotion. Nailing it then, at that point turns into a question of manly pride, arising the basic nature of each man in the town.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Jallikettu, not in the slightest degree unobtrusively, is significant of the gross viciousness we are utilized to for the sake of manliness. It sparkles a mirror at the essence of the machismo we have disguised as a general public. In a story that beginnings as man versus wild, it doesn&#8217;t take that some time before man turns into nature.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Chemban Vinod, Antony Varghese, Sabumon Abdusamad and Santhy Balachandran, every great entertainer, leaves their imprint inside the restricted screen time they get. Yet, by the day&#8217;s end, Jallikettu won&#8217;t be referred to for their acting alone as this is the account of a horde. The push, and push and pull of Jallikettu comes from inside the group. Also, that carries us to the splendid execution, all things considered, Jallikettu radiates through with the astounding and entrancing visuals Girish Gangadharan advances in the race, just as the interruption. His proficient focal point captures the crowd unequivocally to what should be watched. Prashant Pillai is an artist who appreciates and moves music and quiets the same. In Jallikettu, where furious mayhem results, his nuanced music, and frequently deficiency in that department, places in the perfect measure of mental stability into the story so the crowd can get a handle on what unfurls on the screen. Supporting the ease of the account further is Renganaath Ravee&#8217;s sound plan.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Jallikettu depends on a brief tale, named Maoist, composed by Hareesh S. Also, he, when all is said and done, adjusts it for screen alongside Jayakumar. Be that as it may, Jallikettu is to a lesser extent a story and more a circumstance. What&#8217;s more, having not many discoursed all through works in certain spots, yet additionally leaves a ton implied.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Jallikettu is a visual encounter to observe on the big screen. A scene &#8211; now and again alarming, shocking &#8211; and exciting simultaneously. It isn&#8217;t so much that that much with regards to the story, yet about base machismo that drives the testosterone-y male species and the degree of destruction man is able to do.</span>
