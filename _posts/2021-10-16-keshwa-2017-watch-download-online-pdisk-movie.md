    There are no provocative discoursed in the film and it&#8217;s not actually a homicide secret.

    Cinematographer Divakar Mani ought to get a congratulatory gesture for his wonderful picturesque photography. His shots of the waterfront region make one can&#8217;t help thinking about why anybody needs to travel to another country for areas.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    The other feature is Prasanth Pillai&#8217;s experience score, which is truly splendid and makes the disposition. Both Prashanth and Divakar stand like two columns for this film.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Krishna Chaitanya&#8217;s discoursed are acceptable. There are a few openings in the plot and characterisation, for example, neighborhood cops played by Brahmaji and Ajay who act better than an extraordinary examination official, or how the youthful Keshava comes to realize that there are many cops engaged with his folks killing.&nbsp;
