    <span>When a struggling writer receives dumped by way of his lady friend, he creates love memories where he finally ends up as the larger guy who has sacrificed for romance — or so he thinks. When the writing stops and reality hits domestic, no story within the global can fill the void left via the person he loves.</span>

    <span>World Famous Lover Review: Every 2d, million of tales unfold in the world, each exceptional from the other, says the lead character of World Famous Lover, proper at the start of the movie. This love tale, however, seems to be doomed right from the outset and is ridden with angst, sorrow and frustration. If the story doesn&#8217;t have a glad ending, director Kranthi Madhav introduces us to extra fictional tales and tries to tie all of it together to the principle plot. But when the crux of the tale is sullen, bitter and green with envy, the film is often headed towards a disaster. World Famous Lover comes across as a caustic rant of a disgruntled writer who subjects the audience to two hours and 36 mins of his tears and frustration.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As soon because the movie begins, we are added to the tale of Gautham (Vijay Deverakonda) and Yamini (Raashi Khanna), a younger couple in a live-in relationship. But matters are some distance from rosy. Yamini is suffocated in a loveless dating. She goes to work, at the same time as Gautham, a suffering creator, lazes at domestic, sleeps in and watches cartoons on televison. Gautham is messy, unkempt and lacks cognizance while Yamini sobs her manner through existence, while ingesting, lovemaking and bathing — till she cannot take it anymore. When Yamini comes to a decision to go away Gautham, he comes to a decision to start writing once more to prove a point to her, and he introduces us to the world of Seenayya (Vijay Deverakonda), Suvarna (Aishwarya Rajesh) and Smitha (Catherine Tresa). Gautham makes use of those fictional characters to experience better about himself and to persuade Yamini to take him back, but whilst the bubble bursts, will he be capable of shop his dating?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Perhaps the simplest saving grace of this film is Vijay Deverakonda&#8217;s awesome execution of the Telangana dialect as the coal mine worker Seenayya. There&#8217;s a gem of a scene whilst Seenayya shoots back at his dad whilst he asks him in which he&#8217;s off to on his motorcycle. It&#8217;s perhaps the only scene which makes you smile a piece and offers you a breather from the film&#8217;s morose theme.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>A small-city mine employee&#8217;s romance with an upmarket, sophisticated girl, although fictional, appears unrealistic. But Seenayya&#8217;s story is the simplest element that stands out in World Famous Lover. If Gautham and Yamini&#8217;s story is shockingly dour, Gautham&#8217;s love story with Iza (Izabelle Leite) is farcical. When Gautham lands in Paris and says &#8216;Hola&#8217;, you already know matters can get problematic. He soon gets a French female friend, who, get this, speaks Telugu and could best have sex after marriage. It&#8217;s less of a love tale and extra of 20 minutes of bizarre cinema. Although, as a viewer, you&#8217;ll desire it had gone on for longer because the moment it ends, we&#8217;re brought lower back to Gautham&#8217;s never-ending sobfest.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Vijay Deverakonda yells, cries, punches mirrors, bangs his head in opposition to rocks, speaks Telangana dialect and jumps off planes, however he still remains a helpless spectator as Kranthi Madhav tires the audience along with his gloomy love story. Aishwarya Rajesh sticks out among the ladies with a effective performance. Raashi Khanna is wasted in a poorly written person, where all she does is sob. Both Catherine and Izabelle are decreased to inconsequential roles.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>For a film that is presupposed to be an ode to like, World Famous Lover has very little love and an entire lot of bitterness. And for all the unhappiness on display, no longer once do you empathise with any of the person&#8217;s plight. When Yamini leaves Gautham, you think she should&#8217;ve executed it sooner. When Gautham punches matters round and makes a scene, you draw back. And when he beats himself up and wails &#8220;I don&#8217;t have absolutely everyone&#8221;, you want the film to quit. This is a love tale wherein you don&#8217;t root for the two protagonists to come to be together. The film begins and ends with tears and that is the most effective component you relate to — however for all the wrong motives.</span>
