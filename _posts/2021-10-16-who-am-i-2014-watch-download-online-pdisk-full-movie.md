    <span>A slick and stylish German digital thriller, the nicely chilling and chilling Who Am I – No System Is Safe is another impressive calling card film from director Baran bo Odar (who made the striking crime drama The Silence in 2010), made with a decent arrangement of speed and feeling of climate.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Its mixture of action, anticipation, killings, PC based action (and a tiny bit of bit of kissing) should help its German delivery, and the smooth and intelligent style (there are some astute on-screen graphics) that might work for insightful distributors just as type themed festivals.&nbsp;</span>

        Who Am I – No System Is Safe (a fairly unwieldy title no doubt) is revolved around Benjamin (Tom Schilling), your familiar clichéd PC nerd who needs friends, is bullied at school, has no girlfriend – however he dreams of being with individual understudy (Hannah Herzsprung) – yet loses himself in the realm of PCs. His amazing ability for on-line activity is spotted by the charismatic Max (Elyas M&#8217;Barek), a future revolutionary who longs to &#8220;hack the world,&#8221; however needs Benjamin&#8217;s prodigious skills.&nbsp;

      <div>
        <span>Attracted to Max&#8217;s universe of partying, medications and ladies, Benjamin and Max link with individual techno nerds Stephan (Wotan Wilke Möhring) and Paul (Antoine Monot, Jr.) to frame the programmer collective CLAY (Clowns Laughing @ You) aimed at infiltrating security frameworks and poking fun at the financial world.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>In any case, their activities likewise draw in the attention of police office Europol – headed by Hanne Lindberg (the consistently impressive Trine Dyrholm) – and all the more worryingly sinister and manipulative rival programmer MrX.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>The nicely perplexing plot see Benjamin and his friends brought into a series of risky conspiracies, and between Europol, MrX and a Russian digital mafia organization calling itself FR13ENDS find themselves way over their heads and in genuine physical peril. Benjamin should utilize the entirety of his skills to find an exit plan.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>The climate is impressively sustained and film of veiled programmers mixing on an underground train carriage (to address them interacting on the internet) is a nice affectation, with Baran bo Odar suggesting that hacking is simply like magic – individuals see what they need to. This topic fits the climax of the film as a series of twists within twists (all the more lovely predictable for this kind of film) keeps things intriguing up until the final scene.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>The new confronted Tom Schilling is terrific as Benjamin, a complicated individual given a rent of life through PCs, and is nicely adjusted by the more ebullient characters played by Elyas M&#8217;Barek, Wotan Wilke Möhring and Antoine Monot, Jr. as his programmer buddies. The striking soundtrack by Boys Noize, suits this brilliant techno-thriller rather well.</span>
