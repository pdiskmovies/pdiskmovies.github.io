    <span>New Nordic noir series The Chestnut Man (Kastanjemanden) is on Netflix from September 29. In light of the presentation novel of The Killing maker, Søren Sveistrup, The Chestnut Man is a chilling spine chiller in only 6 scenes that will have you snared.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The Chestnut Man opens with the revelation of the merciless killings of a whole family in a segregated ranch in 1987. Over thirty years after the fact, in present day Copenhagen, a young lady is observed to be fiercely killed in a jungle gym with one of her hands missing. Investigator Naia Thulin (Danica Curcic) is appointed to the situation. With her hesitant new accomplice, Mark Hess (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard), they notice a small doll made of chestnuts lying close to the body. A secretive piece of proof is before long found on the chestnut man—the unique mark of a missing young lady, the little girl of lawmaker Rosa Hartung (Iben Dorner).&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Every one of the elements of an extraordinary Nordic noir are there: rough and grim chronic homicides, a work-fanatical female analyst, an at first antagonistic investigator association, and a dim grizzly, for this situation harvest time, mind-set plaguing all through. Aficionados of The Killing won&#8217;t be disillusioned (despite the fact that they may miss Sarah Lund&#8217;s notorious sweaters).</span>
