  <span>At the point when Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) gets transferred for assessment from a jail homestead to a psychological organization, he expects it will be a less restrictive climate. Be that as it may, the martinet Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) runs the mental ward with an iron clench hand, keeping her patients cowed through misuse, prescription and meetings of electroconvulsive treatment. The skirmish of wills between the rebellious McMurphy and the resolute Ratched before long influences every one of the ward&#8217;s patients.</span>
