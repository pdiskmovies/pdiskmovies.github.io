    <span>Azaan (Sachin Joshi), a unique agent of the Indian intelligence, single-handedly fights India&#8217;s conflict against terror. With muscle and brawn, he battles the enemies who want to unleash a deadly biological struggle towards India from remote shores. Can the loner pull it off?</span>

    <span>Movie Review: It&#8217;s the good Muslim as opposed to the horrific Muslim thesis which the director tries to showcase inside the movie via the characters of Azaan, the diehard patriot, and his brother Amaan, a terrorist. Of direction, do not move seeking out something without a doubt deep and incisive on this popcorn mystery which has nothing to boast approximately except its distinctive locales and its excessive decibel motion cuts. The film hurtles across the globe as Azaan chases the evil Doctor and his gang in Germany, Poland, Hong Kong, Morocco&#8230;And attempts to convey them to e-book earlier than they smuggle the killer virus to Indian seashores.</span>

    <span>Salim-Suleiman&#8217;s track too moves the proper be aware with a few tuneful numbers, but sooner or later it&#8217;s far the action sequences which score principally else. Done with a pizzazz, the chases, the shoot-outs and the fights have a gritty sense to them. More importantly, they cowl up for the full loss of feelings inside the drama and at the part of the actors. Newcomer Sachin Joshi surprisingly performs it deadpan from beginning to quit and Candice Boucher is mere eye sweet. Only Arya Babbar because the mercenary who&#8217;s heady at the cocktail if jung and jihad indicates spunk.</span>
