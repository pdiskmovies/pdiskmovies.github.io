    <span>A visual artist, who despises movies and famous actors, ends up in an off-kilter circumstance when he becomes hopelessly enamored with a film entertainer&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Sammohanam Review: by all accounts, the storyline of Indraganti Mohana Krishna&#8217;s &#8216;Sammohanam&#8217; is pretty much as clich√© as romantic tales go. A person who despises film meets a genius and succumbs to her. In spite of being a major star, the lady&#8217;s genuine side is shown, sans make-up and brilliant airs. Also, our legend has total admittance to her. Exactly when you think a sentiment is blending, everything comes smashing down. Be that as it may, in Sammohanam, the lines among the real world and dream are regularly obscured &#8211; and similar as the lead pair&#8217;s sentiment, a promising performer comes slamming down.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Vijay (Sudheer Babu) is a visual artist who portrays for kids&#8217; books. He peers downward on film and believes it&#8217;s a phony world with counterfeit individuals in it, and continually contends with his dad (Naresh), whose deep rooted dream is to act in films. As destiny would make them shoot, for a significant film happens in their home. The lead entertainer Sameera (Aditi Rao Hydari) is probably the greatest genius in the business, however she has a shortcoming &#8211; she can&#8217;t communicate in Telugu. Sameera demands Vijay to assist with training her in Telugu, and when the shoot is finished, he succumbs to her. Yet, going gaga for a genius isn&#8217;t in every case simple, and Vijay before long understands that he may not be getting the cheerful closure he had longed for.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Strangely, notwithstanding the characterisation of the two, Vijay seems to be the self absorbed man who believes it&#8217;s underneath him to converse with individuals from the film and a person who can&#8217;t take no for an answer, while the genius Sameera is displayed as a basic, weak lady with no brilliant airs by any means.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Picture this, probably the greatest star of the business is shooting the heroes&#8217; home. The person, who sees film stars with scorn, derides her for her exchange conveyance in Telugu. Rather than being disturbed, she welcomes him into her train and demands him to show her Telugu. She then, at that point remains back at their home to eat his mom&#8217;s food, goes on bicycle rides with him, without thinking often about being perceived (In decency, she puts on a hoodie, however it clearly doesn&#8217;t work). At the point when the shooting is done and the unit moves from Vijay&#8217;s home to an open air area in the himalayas, our legend figures out how to go without anyone else right to the specific shoot area to meet the team (regardless of not being in contact with any of them). From that point on, it gets absurd.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Be that as it may, the genuine issue with &#8216;Sammohanam&#8217; lies in its consistency. Directly from the principal scene when Sameera welcomes Vijay into her convoy and she gets a grieved call, you realize something is preparing which we will just come to know later. Furthermore, when the story behind that is at last uncovered, it&#8217;s disappointing (to say the least).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In any case, in a film loaded with banalities, Sammohanam has its snapshots of enchantment. Entertainer Naresh, who plays Sudheer Babu&#8217;s dad, captures everyone&#8217;s attention with his breathtaking comic planning. Truth be told, each scene that he is a section up is clever and he without any assistance makes this a watchable film. As does Pavithra Lokesh as Vijay&#8217;s mom, who illuminates the screen with a tremendous exhibition. Sudheer Babu is downplayed at this point viable, yet it&#8217;s Aditi who shocks with an amazing beginning to her Telugu vocation. Be that as it may, when you have such great exhibitions (capably upheld by the always solid Tanikella Bharani and the very clever Rahul Ramakrishna), you can&#8217;t resist the urge to feel let somewhere near a story, which is characterless and unsatisfying.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The blazes of brightness are eclipsed by an anticipated storyline and when the peak is finished, the lone inclination you&#8217;re left with is one of dissatisfaction.</span>
