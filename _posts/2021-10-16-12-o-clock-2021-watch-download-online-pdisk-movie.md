    <span>The story spins around a little youngster, Gauri, who is damaged by the continuous bad dreams she encounters consistently, which regularly prompts sleepwalking.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Audit: The underlying scenes express that irregular people are getting killed in Mumbai and there is some chronic executioner behind these shocking violations. Without any ties between the homicides, soon enough the center movements to a school young lady Gauri (Krishna Gautam), who has out of nowhere become unapproachable and gone calm. Gauri begins having these bad dreams and even beginnings sleepwalking, however her relatives are uninformed of these episodes. Notwithstanding, the new changes in her conduct catch everybody&#8217;s eye, particularly her friends and family and a meddlesome neighbor. Are these side effects of pre-test pressure? Or on the other hand there is something different that is pestering this young lady shapes the core of the story.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>With sensibly great entertainers and a story that had the material to transform into something striking, chief essayist Ram Gopal Varma presents an insane stock of some immature characters and the not really persuading subplots (for example, the condition among Gauri and her sweetheart, and that of Francis (Manav Kaul) and his better half (Flora Saini) – is befuddling). In the primary half one gets exhausted attempting to sort out what&#8217;s up with the lead character. At last, the last part keeps you snared particularly when the new characters—Mithun Chakraborty as a therapist, Debholay, and Manav Kaul as experience trained professional, Francis Desouza—are presented. In general, it&#8217;s an indifferent exertion from RGV who has recently coordinated blood and gore movies, for example, &#8216;Bhoot&#8217;, &#8216;Phoonk&#8217; and &#8216;Vastu Shastra&#8217;.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Notwithstanding a scene, where you see Gauri unexpectedly awakening in the evening and in the ensuing part where she turns her neck, its remainder simply neglects to creep you out. With no significant leap startles, the film gets dreary and the span (112 minutes) appears endless. Nonetheless, the foundation score by MM Keeravani (of Baahubali distinction) and Amol Rathod&#8217;s cinematography is effective in giving some spine-chilling minutes that will definitely keep one at the edge of their seats.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Going to the exhibitions, debutante Krishna Gautam is persuading as Gauri yet needs conviction as a had young person. Mithun Chakraborty and Manav Kaul help in pushing the account forward. Makrand Deshpande as Gauri&#8217;s stressed and powerless dad gives a nice presentation, as well. However his demonstration was a bit off in the enthusiastic scenes, particularly when he is seen crying tears on screen.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>On the off chance that you get scared effectively, you may wouldn&#8217;t fret this one. Notwithstanding, as a thrill ride that is focussed on &#8216;one&#8217;s trusts in heavenly exercises just when they have confronted themselves&#8217;, &#8217;12 &#8216;o&#8217; Clock&#8217; neglects to hold your consideration for a really long time and winds up being a bit of a drag.</span>
