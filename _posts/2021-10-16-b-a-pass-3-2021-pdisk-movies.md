    <span>Chief maker Narendra Singh is back with the third installment of BA Pass franchise, BA Pass 3. The film spins around those unwanted relationships, which are made and then, at that point they are rebuffed as well.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>BA Pass 3 narrates the account of a jobless Anshul (Armaan Sandhu), who initiates an extra marital affair with Pallavi (Ankita Chouhan) through messaging. Her husband Atul (Sunny Sachdeva) is enamored with Ruby (Ankita Sahu). The story takes a u-turn when these four run into each other paths and their lives change until the end of time.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Maker Narendra Singh has helmed the film as well. He has beautifully executed a mind boggling story of disloyalty. Nonetheless, Bollywood has seen many similar stories in the past contacting this touchy subject, but BA Pass 3 is youthful, relatively relevant and relatable to individuals battling marriages in the urban areas. Authors Deep Chugh and Narendra Singh does equity to the characters and narrating.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film is brilliantly shot by ace cinematographer Anmol Dhiman. The music formed by Altaaf-Manny is contemporary and ear-relieving.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Popular TV actor Sunny Sachdeva marks his feature debut with the film. Besides being a gorgeous actor, his performance is real. He appears to have potential. Armaan Sandhu is raw and does fairly well. Ankita Chouhan and Ankita Sahu are acceptable as well. The solitary glitch is the runtime of the film, the pace of the film might have been somewhat fast.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>In case you are up for an emotional flick, do watch BA Pass 3, streaming on Filmybox app.</span>
