    <span>Thittam Irandu starts with what could be a natural misunderstanding to a considerable lot of us. A lady sheets a sleeper transport just to find that she needs to impart her billet to a man! The lady is Aadhira (Aishwarya Rajesh), a police investigator. The man, Arjun (Subash Selvam), is by all accounts a man of honor, and Aadhira is taken in by his activities, and even fosters a pulverize on him.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The following day, she discovers Arjun, an entertainer, at her station, wanting to get consent to permit the cops for a couple of days to get ready for a job. Progressively, Aadhira falls head over heels for Arjun. In the interim, she becomes acquainted with that her cherished companion Surya (Ananya Ramprasad) has bafflingly vanished and begins examining. Her better half, Kishore (Gokul Anand), a specialist, is by all accounts acting dubiously. There is an impaired individual (Pavel Navageethan) who is likewise a suspect. Furthermore, Arjun, too, is by all accounts in any way associated with this secret in some way or another. Can Aadhira handle the disclosures that her request will hurl?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Secured by an amazing Aishwarya Rajesh, Thittam Irandu is an analytical film of unobtrusive scale (and making) and marginally greater (and surprisingly loftier) desires that needs to be an enthusiastic show in excess of a nail-gnawing spine chiller. There is a Gautham Menon-ish energy to the heartfelt parts. The meet-adorable is practically similar to what you may discover in that chief&#8217;s film, with the exception of one inversion&#8230; Here, it is the young lady who starts succumbing to the person, and begins to gaze at him. Another heartfelt scene, which we get later, likewise goes over along these lines.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In any case, the insightful parts aren&#8217;t unreasonably hearty. Notwithstanding the score attempting to make us shudder of Ratsasan, Aadhira&#8217;s examination does not have the fervor that such scenes give since everything in settled in an oversimplified way. Like the experience with the actually tested suspect, which is composed and organized awkwardly. What&#8217;s more, the distractions (like honor killing) are excused from the plot rather quickly, maybe on the grounds that the chief was certain about his enormous wind.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Resulting in these present circumstances climactic contort, however much it is an amazement, it additionally changes the tone of the film. Given the affectability of the subject in question, the movie producer figures out how to cause us to sympathize with his characters and their circumstances, instead of cause them to feel like exaggerations. The manner in which this disclosure looks back to the film&#8217;s absolute first scene &#8211; including a mistake of sexual orientation character &#8211; is an extremely flawless touch, yet the change in tone is peculiar.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Overall, Thittam Irandu is generally okayish whodunit with a turn that is certainly something that we don&#8217;t anticipate, however the degree to which this wind works for you will choose how well you may take a gander at the film eventually.</span>
