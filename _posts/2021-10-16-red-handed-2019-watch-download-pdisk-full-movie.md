<span>Red Handed beginnings with a Pagan custom that was once well known in the neighborhood the twelfth century, one with genuine detestations. We see Lou (Michael Madsen) a grease monkey in the town now, he has three kids Gus (Carnes), Pete (Burke) and Duffy (Christen Madsen) with his own relationship with his siblings Reynolds (Biehn) and Dale (Salomon) being far off. </span>

<span><br />At the point when Lou gets murdered by his sibling, the siblings return to the town without precedent for years to spread his remains. This outing brings back the recollections of the three&#8217;s adolescence, where one of them once disappeared, following the customs of the space, which may have a justification for their dad&#8217;s passing. </span>

<span><br />Characters – Reynolds is the sibling of Lou, he is more established and has consistently stayed nearer to the family customs. Duffy is the child that is nearest to his dad, he has his own family regardless of whether there are a couple of issues in his marriage, he is hesitant to sees his siblings, however should work with them throughout the end of the week. Pete is the oldest of the siblings, he prefers the calm of the world dissimilar to the next as well, just as having an injury from his past which he doesn&#8217;t care to open up about. Lou is their dad who has consistently attempted to keep them close, yet very much like him with his siblings, has seen them becoming far off. We do have three siblings that have become far off, which sees them rejoining having issues between them. </span>

<span><br />Exhibitions – We do have two major names in this film with Michael Biehn and Michael Madsen who are here to show the experience the film needs, while the more youthful cast, where Christian Madsen, Owen Burke and Ryan Carnes all function admirably in the broken kin. </span>

<span><br />Story – The story here follows three siblings that meet up for their dad&#8217;s memorial service just to wind up in the center of an agnostic local area that their dad would not like to be part off. This is a story that can be parted into two, the siblings meeting up shows that life can push family&#8217;s separated and returning together can assist issues with being talked through, this is all incredible. At the point when we take a gander at the opposite side of the story we are managing agnostic devotees which is more with regards to them arranging behind the scenes without getting into the genuine profundities of the custom. </span>

<span><br />Spine chiller – The film attempts to keep us speculating on the thing will occur straightaway, yet we never get the power we could get with the agnostic style movie. </span>

<span><br />Settings – The film keeps us in the little backwoods homes, which are close to noteworthy significant areas, which helps keep everything contained. </span>

<span><br />Scene of the Movie – Brothers together once more, contacting second between the siblings. </span>

<span><br />That Moment That Annoyed Me – Most of the Pagan side didn&#8217;t feel like it was adequately significant. </span>

<span><br />Last Thoughts – This is a thrill ride that doesn&#8217;t hit the statures it could, the committed relationship between siblings is the feature, while the agnostic side nearly feels labeled on.</span>
