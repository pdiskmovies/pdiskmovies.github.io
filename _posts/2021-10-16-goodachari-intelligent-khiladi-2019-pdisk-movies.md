    <span>Intelligent Khiladi (Goodachari) Story: Gopi (Adivi Sesh), assumed name Arjun, is the child of an ex-Crude specialist Raghuveer. Raised by his uncle Satya (Prakash Raj), he needs to be a specialist actually like his dad and uncle.

    <span>Intelligent Khiladi(Goodachari) Audit:&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>With intelligent Khiladi &#8216;Goodachari&#8217; we at long last have our own personal James Bond, as Trinetra Specialist 116. Yet, before Gopi, moniker Arjun (Adivi Sesh), can arrive, he needs to cross a ton of obstacles kindness of who he turns out to be. In any case, what his identity is, or anybody in the film truly, is something that must be uncovered on the big screen.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Gopi drives an ordinary and content life as Arjun, with the assistance of his uncle Satya (Prakash Raj). He harbors the fantasy about turning into a specialist like his dad Raghuveer and serving the country. In a day to day existence loaded up with torment because of Raghuveer&#8217;s passing, Sameera Rao (Sobhita Dhulipala) shows up like some truly necessary balm. Delightful and autonomous, the two experience passionate feelings for and choose to get hitched.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>All that is by all accounts working out positively for Arjun when he&#8217;s additionally chosen to be a Trinetra specialist subsequent to substantiating himself and ascending from longshot status. However, when his life is thrown separated indeed by the most needed psychological militant Rana, Gopi needs to discover an exit plan the wreck. Who is Rana and what is his issue with Gopi? Like Supriya Yarlagadda&#8217;s person Nadiya Qureshi says in the film, nothing in their field (or the film) is a fortuitous event.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The most awesome aspect of Intelligent Khiladi (&#8216;Goodachari&#8217;) other than the charming plot, is the characterisation of Gopi. The entertainer was not lying when he said he needed to bring a covert agent who was absolutely Indian to Tollywood. Dissimilar to spies in Hollywood movies, he&#8217;s not furnished with smooth suits, cool contraptions and cars et al to improve his life. Since this is a beginning story he has just his all around showed abilities, road brilliant ways and weapon to depend on. In a scene, Gopi and Vennela Kishore&#8217;s person specialist Shyam likewise tell a mindful wisecrack about Trinetra not having the sort of spending Specialist 007 Bond has. They likewise wedge in an Aadhar card joke to make it even more relatable.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Adivi Sesh conveys an awesome presentation as Gopi, a kid who grows up loaded up with torment at his dad&#8217;s demise, just to grow up and discover the significantly more agonizing truth of who his dad truly is. Supriya Yarlagadda is a characteristic and totally inconspicuous with her power as the Crude battle head Nadiya. Madhu Shalini is OK in her job of specialist Leena, while Sobhita Dhulipala is stunningly lovely as Sameera Rao, a person she floats through. Anish Kuruvilla, Vennela Kishore, Prakash Raj and the renowned concealed baddie who plays Rana likewise convey staggering exhibitions.</span>
