    <span>Madhuri Dixit made her hotly anticipated Marathi acting introduction in last year&#8217;s Bucket List. While the film earned blended surveys, her presentation was generally acclaimed. She presently follows it up with her first Marathi creation, 15 August, made under her RnM Moving Pictures pennant. While she must be lauded for selecting to toss her parcel behind a story set in an unmistakable milieu inhabited by genuine, conceivable characters, the film might have finished with more flash.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>15 August is basically about charming people whose offenses &#8211; even those of a drunkard who wakes from his inebriated daze occasionally to bore some sense into those that are pretty much as calm as an adjudicator yet rushing around like a burnt feline &#8211; are prominently excusable. You need to enter their reality &#8211; and their minds &#8211; yet the cursory treatment and the simple idea of the circumstances they are tossed into come in the method of a more profound commitment with the people of Gandhi Chawl, where the greater part of the activity unfurls.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Composed by Yogesh Vinayak Joshi and coordinated by Swapnaneel Jayakar, this cut of-life show works out over a couple of significant hours of a solitary morning in the working class chawl. It turns around two equal account axles, one including an effervescent kid in a real sense in a &#8216;spot&#8217; of trouble, the other relying on an inconsistently conditional youngster at risk for losing the young lady he cherishes. Neither one of the strands advances past the commonplace. Therefore, 15 August, similar to Bucket List, is a benevolent exertion that strains for impact however falls way, way shy of the bar it sets for itself.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>It is not difficult to understand what the producers of the film are attempting to drive at &#8211; 15 August needs us to see the unremarkable chawl as a microcosm of metropolitan India &#8211; yet the outcome doesn&#8217;t exactly have the right stuff. One man depicts the spot as being &#8220;like India, just rubbish, no turn of events&#8221;. The characters, be that as it may, aren&#8217;t by and large terrible &#8211; they are decent Marathi people who surrender to their instilled quirks when they wind up facing a startling emergency.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>These affable individuals are played by a cast of equipped entertainers who give a valiant effort to brighten up the tone and tenor of the film. In any case, burdened with a screenplay that doesn&#8217;t actually pulsate with life and transcend the shallow, they can&#8217;t transform 15 August into a motorcade of joys. Not exclusively is the storyline is horribly dainty, the film&#8217;s chief struggle focuses are too thought up to even consider being completely persuading.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>As the film opens, the inhabitants of the chawl are getting ready to observe Independence Day. The crowd is acquainted with the central participants through a line of verbose blazes. A bunch of guardians gets ready to invite a forthcoming spouse against the desires of their unique girl. A man named Gavaskar (Sanjay Deshpande) practices an Independence Day discourse. A gossip, the know-all Gokhale (Vaibhav Mangle), approaches disclosing to the young men how to lift and spread out the public banner with the guide of a local mechanical gadget. In the midst of this, Plain Jane Sonu (Mayuri Vishnu Mohite), who really likes the film&#8217;s male hero, gives final details to a rangoli around where the flagpole will be planted.</span>
