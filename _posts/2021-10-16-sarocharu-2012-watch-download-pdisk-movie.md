  <span>Sandhya (Kajal) is in love with Karthik (Ravi). She’s stunned to discover that Karthik is a divorcee when she confesses her like to him. When Karthik proposes marriage, Sandhya makes a decision to get married to her cousin Gautham (Nara Rohit) as a substitute.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Movie Review: Seems just like the filmmakers are absolutely involved with the growing divorce fees inside the united states. “Love isn’t a good enough to get married. For a wedding to closing a life-time, the couple need to understand every different completely, and proper love starts offevolved best after marriage!” That’s the noble relationship advice this rom-com propounds, pinpointing that “the lack of know-how” is the basis motive of marriages falling aside. So an awful lot for the gyan, but unluckily the movie appears to don&#8217;t have anything else to provide.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>It all starts in Italy where Sandhya is a pupil (it’s no longer clean what she’s analyzing) primarily based in Italy. She runs into Karthik days before going returned to domestic and he or she’s smitten &#8211; love in the beginning sight! The two show up to board the identical aircraft going again and therefore begins their love tale. But then she’s shattered to whilst Karthik confesses that he’s already married and that he’s on his way back home to get completed with the prison formalities.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Enroute, Karthik comes to a decision to allow her in on his sob story relationship returned three years. That’s whilst Vasu (Richa) steps because the digicam cuts to Ooty. Soon after the flashback ends comes the twist in the story. Sandhya discovers that Karthik wasn’t completely honest about his past and she leaves him fuming whilst he proposes marriage! Her parents determine to get her married to her cousin, Gautham who’s head over heels in love along with her on account that he can do not forget.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>With such tried and tested plots you really need some crackling humor and extremely good on screen chemistry, lamentably this film has neither. Mass Maharaja, Ravi Teja appears to have tried to break far from the mould and tried to do something underplayed, diffused and classy this time round. But the character is just too poorly conceived, styled and done to have any impact in any way. And quite frankly Ravi Teja looks out of intensity and possibly it’s time to think about playing his age and he surely wishes a brand new stylist.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Kajal Aggarwal does her component as does Richa, but neither makes a great deal of an effect.&nbsp;</span><span>The tune by way of Devi Sri Prasad is simply as unremarkable because the rest of the movie. The writing, humor, modifying and packaging all appearance too clichéd and to make subjects worse there seems to me extra philosophizing than any real romance. It all looks a touch too daft ultimately.</span>
