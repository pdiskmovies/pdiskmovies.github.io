    <span>Mr. Raj Kapoor (Ashwin Kaushal), an occupant of Sunflower lodging society, is discovered dead in his condo. At the point when the cops start their examinations, greater part of the inhabitants and continuous guests become suspects. Can the cops break this case?&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Survey: Based in Mumbai, &#8216;Sunflower&#8217; rotates around a homicide that happens in a working class lodging society of a similar name. At the point when Mumbai cops—Digendra (Ranvir Shorey) and Chetan Tambe (Girish Kulkarni) start researching the case, they suspect almost everybody. Be that as it may, Sonu Singh (Sunil Grover), a blockhead living in a similar society, is brought into the homicide secret and turns into the great suspect. What occurs next structures the core of the story.&nbsp;</span>

        This drawing in eight-section situational wrongdoing parody is co-composed by Vikas Bahl (author head of well known Bollywood films &#8216;Sovereign&#8217; and &#8216;Super30&#8217;) and Chaitali Parmar. Alongside Rahul Sengupta, Vikas wears the chief&#8217;s cap in this series, which denotes his computerized debut also. Directly from the beginning, the crowd knows about how one of the general public&#8217;s inhabitants (Raj Kapoor) passed on. Yet, it&#8217;s the story—which rotates around the examination procedures and how everybody squeezes into the speculate class—that has been curiously written down with a scramble of humor and a lot of rushes.&nbsp;

        <span>The screenplay is fascinating all through, on account of its particular characters with odd spasms and qualities that characterize them, just as the subplots that mix well into this person driven plot. For example, Sonu Singh, a 35-year-old offbeat sales rep with Obsessive-enthusiastic turmoil (OCD), keeps everything impeccably coordinated—from his foot mat to everything on his work table. Dilip Iyer (Ashish Vidyarthi) is another person who tries to be the administrator of Sunflower Society to make it a more joyful spot to live. Envision he has a panel of individuals that talk with every individual who wishes to remain in this general public and have severe principles against permitting unmarried individuals, divorced people, queers, etc. Then, at that point, there&#8217;s Mr Ahuja (Mukul Chadda), an instructor by calling with a smirky appearance and a considerate disposition, and his always steady spouse (Radha Bhatt). Generally speaking, most of the scenes rotate around a little gathering of society individuals, portraying everything from inward society governmental issues to intrusive neighbors.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>While the initial not many scenes keep you snared essentially because of the inclusion of such countless characters and their own lives, just as their connection to the wrongdoing, there are some that drag on, particularly those including Sonu really focusing on Mr. Tondon (Sameer Kakkar). Preferably, the more limited scenes and tight altering (by Konark Saxena) would have supported the plot&#8217;s movement while keeping up with the show&#8217;s speed. The foundation score made by Sahej Bakshi and Vesh Shrivastava is intriguing and supplements the story well.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>Sunil Grover plays Sonu Singh flawlessly, never wandering from his job as a desolate man with no group of friends because of his bizarre conduct. Sonu just addresses his mom and appreciates participating in extended discussions with selling guests. He has his own arrangement of rules, for example, &#8220;In fellowship, no grieved, pass, and no udhaar (credit),&#8221; – how filmi! He likewise keeps similar credulous articulations all through, which will without a doubt help some to remember the fervent devotees of his well known comedic persona &#8216;Gutthi&#8217;.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>Both the police investigators, Ranvir Shorey as a straightforward cop and Girish Kulkarni as his companion in the examination, give sincere exhibitions while tracking down the missing bits of the riddle. The shudh-hindi discussions and articulations of Mr Ahuja (played by Mukul Chadda) are exceptional. His on-screen spouse Radha Bhatt has a couple lines, yet her response to her significant other&#8217;s constant suspicion is convincing.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>To summarize, while the thought of giving a homicide secret a funny bone is special in certain perspectives, the series&#8217; laid-back execution can make it dreary to watch now and again. Notwithstanding, this eight-section series will keep you engaged for most parts — with its abnormal yet interesting characters and some amazing deeds.</span>
