    <span>Chopsticks is being promoted as a first of its sort – a Netflix &#8216;unique&#8217; Hindi film. It gets going with a trace of guarantee, with an established in-her-working class-values-Maharashtrian-&#8216;mulgi&#8217; Nirma Sahastrabuddhe (Palkar) gaining her first sparkling new vehicle. As we track Nirma visiting with her mother through Mumbai&#8217;s packed streets, the person begins coming to fruition: Nirma is a standard abider-and-breaker (chatting on the cellphone and driving, while at the same time gesturing obediently alongside her &#8216;aai&#8217;), an audience of &#8216;personal development&#8217; tips, and unmistakably somebody who is a genuine, interesting young lady.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>At the point when Nirma likewise uncovers her burdensome, weak side at the work-place, with a manager from heck, and disagreeable associates, we can&#8217;t resist the urge to pull for her. Be that as it may, the set-up, what begins with potential, disentangles all around soon to uncover a film which has no clue about what it needs to be: is it a romantic comedy, a frolic through-huge awful Mumbai, a transitioning show… what, precisely?</span>
