    <span>There are movies you watch and right away fall in love with trying to observe it once more. Then there are movies you watch and restrict yourself to looking it that one time in no way repeating it once more. And then there are movies which offer you any such headache which you repent even entering the theatre for it. Aagah – The Warning would not are available in any of these classes. Instead, it is available in a category in which while watching the film you sense like searching down the maker of the movie and doing the maximum terrible things possible to him, torturing him even in addition for making this kind of torturous film you needed to undergo. Yes, Aagah – The Warning is that pathetic!</span>

    <span>An innocent boatman Ramsharan (Karan Razdan) is captured on excessive seas with the aid of the terrorists and is shot down with the aid of the leader of the jihadis Azaan Khan (Atul Kulkarni). Ramsharan&#8217;s circle of relatives within the village which includes his father Devsharan (Satish Kaushik), mom Dulariben (Ila Arun) spouse Megha (Rituparna Sen) and daughter Muskaan (Jannat) , they all grieve the loss of life of Ramsharan. Muskaan has a whole lot of harmless questions on her father loss of life. Later on, a spirit starts offevolved to hang-out Muskaan. The useless are trying to attain out to her. Why? Why is a person dead trying to reach out to her and her own family. The Nawab of the district (Zakir Hussein) takes a keen hobby inside the own family. A Moulana (Anang Desai) attempts to assist the Sharan own family. He introduces them to Peer Jammatuddin Shah Baba (Anupam Kher). The Peer fakir attempts to exorcise the spirit from Muskaan being however he fails. A strange component happens one night time. The spirit attacks, but the family fights again. The spirit escapes through the chimney. But the bizarre component is that the spirit has written something on the wall. But it is in historical Urdu. Which even the maulana cannot read. Whose spirit is it? Is it an historical spirit? What is it trying to mention or do?</span>

  <div>
    <span>My only query is, why? Why make such a product?! Nothing works for the film! The handiest exact (if you could dare to use that adjective after looking the movie) element approximately the film is Atul Kulkarni, Jannat Zuber, Satish Kaushik and Anupam Kher&#8217;s performances. Firstly, the movie is extraordinarily overdramatic and loud. It has even beat Ram Gopal Verma in the use of torturous history track. Even in sorrowful scenes like the ones regarding death, you simply do not sense sorry for them. The boatman&#8217;s circle of relatives&#8217;s after-demise crying saga just is going on and on. It in no way ends! Considering the movie has actually given the ghost a coloration – white, it reminded me of the bathing powder Tide&#8217;s ads. Also, each person death in the movie simply has to mention 2 – three dialogues before loss of life. What&#8217;s that? Are we doing a film from the 80&#8217;s? Also, their own family appears to be the only circle of relatives inside the entire village maximum of the time. Why, have been the junior artists so pricey? Plus, Rituparna Sen Gupta&#8217;s hands appear to be more effective than any weapon in the world! Considering, she ought to simply prevent the ghost to enter her daughter&#8217;s body with simply her naked hands! Absolutely ridiculous!</span>

  <div>
    <span>By the cease of the film in which the actual message is brought, even if you&#8217;re nonetheless in the target audience, you simply do not care. Who lives, who dies, and who&#8217;s the ghost, something! It&#8217;s a nice message being advised in the end, but the movie does not even hold you interested for the first 20 mins, forget about about doing so till the give up.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Director Karan Razdan need to be happy with at least making some mark in Bollywood by making one of the worst Bollywood films of all time. The screenplay isn&#8217;t even well worth citing. The modifying is horrible, scenes begin from nowhere in between. At times, you won&#8217;t even understand whilst the next scene has started. Terrible! The cinematography is ok.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Coming to the performances, Jannat Zuber, Atul Kulkarni, Satish Kaushik and Anupam Kher are the excellent. Rituparna Sen overacts so terrible which you want she both takes an performing class right away, or cease the industry! Ila Arun is a ache! When she shouts, you wish you have been deaf.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Overall, there may be nothing to mention about this film. It&#8217;s an absolute waste of effort, money and time. The author and director of the movie Karan Razdan says &#8216;The film is born out of undeniable. The movie, although a supernatural thriller, cries out for peace and compassion for human struggling.&#8217; I do apprehend the crying out for human suffering part (especially in Ila Arun and Rituparna Sen&#8217;s torturous scenes) and am sure he supposed born out &#8216;for&#8217; ache! And allow&#8217;s no longer even go to the apparently being a &#8216;supernatural mystery&#8217; component. In brief, Warning: Don&#8217;t watch it!</span>
