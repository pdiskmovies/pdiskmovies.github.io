    <span>Repairman Jack (MacLeod Andrews) is sincerely busy repairing a house which has seen an inquisitively high number of its tenants hastily depart throughout the long term. Before adequately long, Jack finds the home to be haunted by a ghost – or as she likes to be called, a &#8220;spectral agent&#8221; – named Muriel (Natalie Walker), who is tasked with scaring away the occupants.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>

        However the pair get themselves naturally in conflict, a romantic bond rapidly creates, compelling them to consider whether there&#8217;s any chance of a future together.&nbsp;

      </span></div> 
      
      <div>
        <span>Rather suggestive of David Lowery&#8217;s A Ghost Story, Stovall&#8217;s movie strikingly engages with the metaphysical on a careful financial plan, utilizing sharp, unobtrusive directorial twists to make the a large portion of what&#8217;s available, namely a vacant house and a pair of convincing actors.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>For a large part of the film&#8217;s first half, we&#8217;re basically hanging out with Jack in the house as faintly amusing supernatural happenings happen, from cabinets opening all alone to music playing surprisingly from Jack&#8217;s radio.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>Similarly as this tires, the peculiar central meet-adorable starts in earnest, with Muriel announcing herself outwardly to an alternately unnerved and fascinated Jack. Yet, Stovall&#8217;s ambition doesn&#8217;t simply stop at bringing ghosts – heartbroken, spectral agents – to the screen without a VFX financial plan, as he also leaps off to investigate the vaguely Kafkaesque bureaucracy inside which these agents dwell.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>For reasons unknown, Muriel is pretty much a representative of an ambiguous supernatural outfit, bringing out both the cruel paper-pushing of Terry Gilliam&#8217;s Brazil and the prepared afterlife of classic existential computer game Grim Fandango.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>The film is absolutely at its best, nonetheless, when zeroed in on Jack and Muriel exchanging charming banter and becoming acquainted with each other, especially as, for a period, the romantic tale isn&#8217;t laid on too thickly. Disappointment abounds somewhat, then, at that point, when the third act conveys various half-baked thoughts about the motivation behind life – or, even, the afterlife – amid a devised romantic tale that never fully persuades.</span>
