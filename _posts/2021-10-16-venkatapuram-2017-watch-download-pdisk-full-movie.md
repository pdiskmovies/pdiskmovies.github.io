    <span>Venkatapuram is a movie you&#8217;ll get when a chief doesn&#8217;t pander to business commitments and trusts his story. Against a Vizag background, Venu Madikanti bundles a story that is loaded with convenient turns in a non-straight account. The vengeance adventure that runs well under two hours gives the Happy Days entertainer Rahul (as the hero Anand, a pizza conveyance kid) something to cheer about. In view of a genuine concealment story that offers a slip look into the working of the police framework, Venkatapuram is a smooth trip, whose show and activity components are bundled in the right extent.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>The film opens with a puzzling homicide at Bheemili where what you see isn&#8217;t actually what you get. Anand is a great suspect in the occurrence, yet his adaptation of the story could do a ton to uncover the shady idea of the case. An excursion into his past uncovers he&#8217;s a vagrant, who has not a lot to his life past his bills and his work at a pizza joint. The film takes us through his situation with Chaitra, an understudy and how an occurrence changes the young person into a no nonsense vengeance searcher. Retribution is absolutely celebrated here and the chief never attempts to be socially sensitive it is possible that, he keeps the discourse insignificant and utilizes artistic freedoms to take specific circumstances forward.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>If by some stroke of good luck the film had shown greater affectability in its depiction of a trendy young lady; examples like the one where Chaitra and her companions hang out at the school patio for a smoke are evidence of that. At places, the film is fairly like the Tamil film Visaranai on how legislators and cops work; Venkatapuram takes a highly contrasting perspective on the framework.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>While the account scores, the film has little to flaunt about in the presentation its lead cast. Rahul&#8217;s conditioned constitution gets sufficient concentration however his non-verbal communication plainly passes on a great deal to be wanted. To the producer&#8217;s credit, the complex job does well to conceal his deficiencies. There are lip sync issues with the exchanges, for the most part for the debutante Mahima Makhwana, who advances from TV to films easily. In any case, this movie works in light of executive control, Venu liberates the outcome from tangled sub-plots and is additionally supported by the cinematographic allure and Achu&#8217;s inconspicuous music score.</span>
