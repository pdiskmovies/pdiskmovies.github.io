  <span>In simple phrases, andhaghaaram method darkness, absence of mild. But in Vignarajan’s movie, it acquires multidimensional meanings. It stares you within the face and yet, is metaphorical. But, do audiences get the gist?</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Vinod (Arjun Das) is a upset cricketer who makes his living via training kids in the sport. Life turns into a residing hell for him whilst he begins receiving calls on his landline from an anonymous individual, who is in possession of a completely deep, dark secret of his. After repeated insistence from his lady friend Manasi (Meesha Ghoshal), he makes a decision to are seeking for help from a reputed psychiatrist, Dr Indran (Kumar Natarajan). Vinod gets his contact from Pooja (Pooja Ramachandran), his excellent friend Pradeep’s sister. An RTO team of workers, Pooja moonlights as a trainer, coaching visually challenged college students, along with Selvam (Vinoth Kishan), a librarian. Are their connections as simple as they seem? Or is there greater than what meets the eye?</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Debutant Vignarajan (who has additionally written the story) has a stable subject matter in hand – 4 distinctive human beings, four one of a kind tales, all connected with the aid of a single thread. Each character is well written and has sufficient meat. The actors, too, have sunk their teeth into their elements with an awful lot gusto. Arjun showcases both his machismo and vulnerability effectively – he’s aggressive in the scenes wherein he desperately wants to escape from the caller, and cowers with worry while he realises that he may additionally have encountered some thing paranormal. Vinoth impresses as a visually impaired librarian – he is effortless while dealing with Braille and absolutely seems the element. Pooja and Kumar Natarajan have played their components subtly, however leave at the back of a deep affect. Edwin Sakay’s camera (the first few frames assist set up the temper of the film fantastically), Rembon Balraj’s art manufacturing (Arjun’s single-room house is immediately out of mafia movies, but the purple set-up makes it eerie. And oh, the ones rotary dial phones are pretty placing, we ought to say) and Pradeep Kumar’s tune increase the narration.</span>

<div>
  <span>But there’s some thing about the packaging that doesn&#8217;t quite sit down proper – it’s the thread that connects the testimonies collectively. It’s flimsy, it is free, however you comprehend that most effective when you attain the climax. At 2 hours 51 minutes, the film is too long. Though the narration keeps you glued, a lacklustre twist makes you query if your persistence turned into well worth it. The film claims to be a supernatural thriller, but there’s no spook in the story. Psychological factors? Aplenty. But the kick back within the tale is lost somewhere among wanting to be each.</span>
