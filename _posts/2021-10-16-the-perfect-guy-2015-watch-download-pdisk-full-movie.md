    <span>You&#8217;ve seen it multiple times previously. A guy succumbs to some unacceptable young lady. A young lady succumbs to some unacceptable guy. In a little while there&#8217;s some genuine following going on and rabbits are being bubbled. Substitute a feline for the rabbit (no spoilers here about its destiny) and you have the incidentally named, nonexclusive spine chiller The Perfect Guy that in some way or another injury up on the big screen rather than on Lifetime.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The story starts with effective business leader Leah (Sanaa Lathan) and her beau of two years, Dave (Morris Chestnut), partaking in a merry relationship. That is, until the responsibility phobic David plays pleasantly with a host&#8217;s youngster at a party and it helps Leah to remember her longing to begin a family. She gives a final proposal that is speedily declined.&nbsp;</span>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Presently she has a relaxed experience with an attractive outsider at a caf√©, who plays out a definitive demonstration of bravery by surrendering his frosted latte. Half a month after the fact he shows up once more, this time avoiding a clumsy alcoholic hitting on Leah at a bar. He presents himself as Carter (Michael Ealy), who works in &#8220;corporate surveillance,&#8221; and when he kisses her toward the finish of their ensuing first date it makes her go powerless at the knees and shout to herself, &#8220;Heavenly mother of God!&#8221;&nbsp;

      <div>
        <span>Carter before long satisfies the nominal depiction, presenting the recently closed up Leah to the delights of sex in a club restroom, but he likewise demonstrates the perfect noble man during an end of the week stay at her folks&#8217; home when he sends her away after she&#8217;s snuck into his doled out isolated room. He figures out how to rapidly prevail upon her sullen, disagreeable father (Charles S. Dutton) by mysteriously delivering a couple of primo ball game tickets.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>Yet, after he unexpectedly ejects into rage and almost pounds the life out of a man at a corner store for the offense of conversing with her, Leah rethinks him and starts to move in an opposite direction from the relationship. At the point when she severs it completely, Carter is uncovered as a raving psycho who will remain determined to get her covered.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>You can basically figure the remainder of the story from here, as the inexorably frantic Leah looks for help from companions and in the long run the police as Carter hacks her telephone and PC, her adored feline vanishes and different other types of anarchy result. A controlling request is given to little impact, and surprisingly actual dangers from Dave, recently back in Leah&#8217;s life, don&#8217;t prevent her stalker, who utilizes his expert abilities in quest for his noxious objectives.</span>
