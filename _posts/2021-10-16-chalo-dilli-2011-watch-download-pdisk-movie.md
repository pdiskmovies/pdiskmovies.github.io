    <span>Manu Gupta (Vinay Pathak) and Mihika Mukherjee (Lara Dutta) are the most mismatched traveling partners who are compelled to adventure together from Mumbai to Delhi, when destiny (or is it the maddening Mumbai site visitors) pits them collectively. Mihika is an uptown funding banker. Manu is a saree dealer from Chandni Chowk. It takes an onerous journey from Jaipur to Delhi for the 2 of them to bridge their cultural and sophistication divide.</span>

    <span>Movie Review: The tale can be easy, directly and sprinkled with all of the predictable twists and turns you could envisage in a drama that pitches a snooty, spoilt woman in opposition to a desi Indian male. There is the same old upturned nostril at the a part of Lara while she is compelled to encounter the dust bowls of mofussil India, which encompass suffering her down-market companions burps and farts. And there may be Vinay Pathak&#8217;s familiar disdain for the girl&#8217;s la-di-dah methods. Also, there are sun shades of the other cult avenue movie, Jab We Met, which cloud the originality of the script.</span>

    <span>But hello, the film has a lot soul in particular inside the climax, it makes up for any shortcomings in story and vision. Also, the narrative has a candy simplicity which transports you into the onscreen journey and makes you a willing witness to the bond-building among &#8216;bhaisaheb&#8217; and &#8216;behenji&#8217;. If Lara Dutta and Vinay Pathak deliver the movie thru with their spontaneity, it&#8217;s far the perimeter characters too who upload spunk to the street show. And if you want some greater masala, there may be Yana Gupta reinventing Zeenat Aman&#8217;s conventional object range `Laila o Laila&#8217;. Needless to mention, Zeenat had more dum&#8230;.</span>
