    <span>Daily Horror Scavenger Hunt 8 â€“ February 2019 Day 20: For no reason at all, we&#8217;re going to watch any movie starring either Jason or Jeremy London. Or both.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Ha! I found a movie with both of the London Boys in it&#8230;granted Jeremy is only in it for 10 seconds or so, but I guess if there&#8217;s a sequel he&#8217;ll have a much bigger role. (&#8220;At least we still have Jeremy&#8221;).</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The shark stuff, apart from a couple of funny moments, is pretty forgettable in this movie. Most of the kills don&#8217;t matter and aren&#8217;t really anything exciting. But this movie is a Syfy movie and it&#8217;s one of those that is all about the humour, rather than anything close to horror. And in the humour department this mostly works. Especially Mr. Jason London playing himself (sort of) as a self-centered celebrity who&#8217;s famous for making a bunch of cheesy shark attack movies (except for part 3!). This movie is all about him and his attempts to look good and make money and be very self involved to the exclusion of everything that&#8217;s going on around him. And I enjoyed it. And I also liked the guy who played his number one fan.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But like I said, the shark stuff is kind of an after thought. At least until a certain character gets killed off, but ya know. It&#8217;s a Syfy shark movie so you know it&#8217;s all bad lines and meta jokes and dumb people doing dumb things and awful cgi sharks. If you don&#8217;t like that then stay away.</span>
