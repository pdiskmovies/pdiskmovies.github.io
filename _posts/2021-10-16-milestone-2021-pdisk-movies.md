    <span>The story follows a moderately aged transporter Ghalib (Suvinder Vicky) who is adapting to the new, appalling end of his significant other. What&#8217;s more, expertly, even subsequent to checking 5,00,000 kilometers out and about, he faces the danger of losing his life-characterizing employment to another driver.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Audit: Set in the edges of Delhi-NCR, &#8216;Milestone&#8217; (also known as Meel Patthar) rotates around two principle characters—Ghalib, a desolate, maturing transporter, who, regardless of being continually driving starting with one spot then onto the next, hasn&#8217;t pushed forward much throughout everyday life and Pash (Lakshvir Saran), a wide-looked at goal-oriented youngster, who is amped up for driving trucks.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>This multifaceted movie is co-composed, altered, and coordinated by Ivan Ayr (known for his 2018 introduction film &#8216;Soni&#8217;) and focusses on the individual and expert battles of truck-industry laborers, who barely appear to live in their perpetual home with their family. They are consistently progressing and think about the truck as their &#8216;home&#8217;. From the initial scene as far as possible, the camera shadows Ghalib trying to cause watchers to feel as though they are following him. The crowd follows him while he strolls with his constant spinal pain, the ceaseless pattern of stacking and dumping of products at his work environment, driving his truck on the parkway and directing his understudy Pash. The nearby shots of the truck tires moving and the dusty parkways keep you moving and associated with the gradually moving characters of Ghalib and Pash.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>The story is straightforward and to the fact of the matter—be it Ghalib adapting to the awfulness of his better half&#8217;s Etali&#8217;s, sudden demise, his back fit or the manner in which he attempts to save his work. The watchers can undoubtedly identify with him and his battles all through the film. Nonetheless, there is a mystery around Ghalib&#8217;s relationship with his significant other that makes the crowd can&#8217;t help thinking about what may have really occurred. The strong screenplay (by Ivan Ayr and Neel Manikant) swings between empathy, holding, and self centered interests among proprietors and their laborers at a slow speed. The portrayal of the proprietors of the organization being unpleasant with more seasoned representatives (who have been working with them for quite a long time) and extending to their employment opportunities to adolescents, is right on target. This is the thing that happened to Ghalib&#8217;s companion and colleague Dilbaug (Gurinder Makna), who had been unexpectedly approached to leave the organization.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>The power in the scenes increment the general effect of the story. The vast majority of the discoursed are a blend of Punjabi and Hindi which consummately mixes with the story giving it a certifiable vibe. The discussions are profound and significant, similar to the scene where Pash comes to see a dead body intently and Ghalib consoles him by saying &#8220;Bhatere meel aane hain,&#8221; (a lot more milestones to come), which plainly indicates that life has recently started and there will be comparable hopeless circumstances one needs to look at each point. Along these lines, face it and be solid!&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Suvinder Vicky captures everyone&#8217;s attention as Ghalib. He obviously utilizes his appearances and profound eyes to pass on the torments of his life. Ghalib being a decent man obliges everything paying little mind to what life tosses at him. In a grouping, he initially excuses the one who arrives up at his home to paint vases, however later permits him to do that very much like the manner in which his dead spouse would have needed. He understands that this individual is additionally a day by day bet and his endeavors to come as far as possible ought not be squandered. Lakshvir Saran is unimaginable as the youth battling between his craving to be quite the requirement for this work and cash. Every one of the ladies in the film are bold and have amazing jobs—be it the female sarpanch-top of the panchayat, (Mohinder Gujral), the penetrated tire fix woman (Shanti Devi) or Ghalib&#8217;s sister-in-law (Gaurika Bhatt).&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Ivan Ayr&#8217;s 97 minutes in length film is certainly an impression of the existence that will keep you included. Some may discover the speed a slight bit moderate however the story rotating around the existence battles of the characters will impact you all through. The film feels like simply the start, not the stopping point.</span>
