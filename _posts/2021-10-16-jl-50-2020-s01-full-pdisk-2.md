    <span>A traveler plane &#8211; AO 26 &#8211; is commandeered and in a distant villa close to Bagdogra, another plane JL 50&#8217;s recently slammed. The catch is that the last had taken off from the Kolkata air terminal 35 years prior and was never seen since that portentous day. How could it crash after so long? Furthermore, what unfolded?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Survey: it is 1984 and pilot Bhiu Ghosh (Ritika Anand, additionally the maker) is glutting on some fast breakfast while her psyche meanders back to the contemplations of a lost adored one. &#8220;Kab tak aisa chalega? Bahut kuch hota hai zindagi mein standard kuch ruk nahin jaata… &#8221; clarifies the mother. &#8220;Aami bhaalo achhi, Maa,&#8221; Bhiu guarantees her and leaves the table, saying she is getting late for her flight. Bhiu Ghosh isn&#8217;t seen for 35 long a very long time until one day, she does.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>On a colder time of year morning, in the far away adjoining slopes of Bagdogra (West Bengal), a plane collides with its thick woods and JL 50 is found. Obviously, the flight was commandeered and there were just two survivors – Bhiu and a specific Mister Biswajeet Chandra Mitra (Piyush Mishra). The fit booted Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) official Shantanu (Abhay Deol) shows up at the emergency clinic for routine addressing – the two survivors haven&#8217;t matured a day and the group is currently bewildered at this disclosure.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Composed and coordinated by Shailender Vyas, the air encompassing &#8216;JL 50&#8217; is exceptional and the characters included talk a particular unassumingly language (with the exception of Rajesh Sharma&#8217;s Gaurango; he&#8217;s intended for entertainment). Valid, lately, this show is by a wide margin one of the most eager science fiction/time travel projects in Indian film and is looking shaking so far. At first, this four-section series features the possibility to set a sensibly high bar for every one of the motion pictures/shows that continue in this class in the years to come. Yet, that sparkle runs out of steam as the show advances – with no guarantees, time travel-meets-noir is a perplexing composite and &#8216;JL 50&#8217; might have been such countless things however it decides to distort the point and be one more crazy interpretation of transtemporal travel all things being equal. Maybe trying to make it simpler for the crowd to understand, Vyas quick advances the subtleties and adds a scramble of dramatization to it – once more, our hunch is that it was to overcompensate for picking a canny topic and oblige the taste buds of the neighborhood content purchasers.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Acting-wise, standing out are two darlings of equal film – Pankaj Kapur as Professor Das and Abhay Deol as official Shantanu. Deol is limited and means business as the committed top cop displaying shades of negativity while being circumspectly inquisitive with regards to the obscure. Kapur is splendid as the dodgy man of quantum physical science sandwiched between sick goals and curiosity. Das is both fanciful and all-knowing, and the veteran entertainer shuffles both the features of his person&#8217;s persona no sweat. Regardless of being the impetus, Mishra&#8217;s Mitra shows up. It would have been fascinating to see a greater amount of him in a similar edge with Pankaj Kapur. Ritika Anand&#8217;s depiction of the recuperating pilot was unconvincing before all else however she skips back towards the end and figures out Bhiu. Be that as it may, Anand actually expected to hone the edges and was the most vulnerable connection of the show.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>&#8216;Jl 50&#8217; is a perfection of folklore, fighting, history and science however it required a top to bottom taking care of which the plot-line lamentably began to need just after the absolute first scene. In any case, we immovably accept that it would be criminal not to support something as trying as this thus the inconsistent VFX hiccups are pardoned only this one time. Why? Since, as Professor Das, said, &#8220;America mein ho toh marvels, humare country primary ho toh just a story?&#8221;</span>
