    <span>A gathering of companions botch two innocuous people for killers during a trip to the timberland, prompting series of occasions that turns genuine constantly, placing them all at serious risk.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Trip Movie Review: Dennis Manjunath&#8217;s Trip is a cross between the Hollywood repulsiveness satire Tucker and Dale versus Evil and the frightfulness spine chiller Wrong Turn. The reason includes a pack of 20-something companions (Sunaina, Pradeep and Co) going to a woodland and getting caught in an awful circumstance. Everything starts with the gathering mixing up Azhagan (Yogi Babu) and Amudhan (Karunakaran), two men who have come to fix a house in the backwoods, for executioners. Furthermore, a progression of occasions brings about the extending of the misconception. What both these gatherings don&#8217;t understand is that the woods has turned into a shelter for a couple of man-eaters, who are out to get them all!&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The primary portion of the film plays out more like a loathsomeness parody, drawing generously from Tucker versus Dale. In any case, the heading doesn&#8217;t show a vibe for this material. Maybe than dark satire, what we get is normal Kollywood parody, the sort where Yogi Babu attempts to triumph ultimately with PJs, affront parody and nonchalantly misogynist comments (kuzhi vetradhu ponnungalukku pazhakkamaana vishayam). All things considered, the parts including Yogi Babu and Karunakaran are the ones that are somewhat intriguing. The scenes highlighting the companions are so mediocre, and the exhibitions are very boring.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film movements to a genuine awfulness spine chiller tone in the second half when the Wrong Turn-impacted plot components become an integral factor. The chief attempts to infuse some creativity by giving us a history about native individuals who are compelled to become man-eaters and tissue eating plants, however this extra data fails to help the film. Notwithstanding the genuine danger that the characters end up in, there are not really any rushes in these segments. Each scene works out in unsurprising design and the excursion to the peak just feels tedious.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Overall, the film, which is capability shot, may appear to be somewhat intriguing for the individuals who haven&#8217;t seen its Hollywood motivations, yet and still, at the end of the day, it is a trip that should be taken with alert.</span>
