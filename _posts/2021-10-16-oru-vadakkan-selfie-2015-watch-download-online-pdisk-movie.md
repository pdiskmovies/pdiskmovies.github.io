    <span>Designing understudy Umesh is a scholastically lost soul, yet wishes to be a movie producer. After an alluring Daisy moves to his neighborhood with her family, he feels spurred to scale more prominent statures so he can dazzle her. A coincidental train venture with her progressions his life until the end of time.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Audit: Oru Vadakkan Selfie is two movies in one. While its brimming with life first half is an entertaining drive around portraying relatable life circumstances of a designing undergrad, the second is a criminal investigator story. Set in regions promoted by Thattathin Marayathu and arranging pretty much comparable characters, one would feel it&#8217;s a remix of the &#8216;ummachikutty-loves-erratic Nair&#8217; story. However, halfway, the film changes track into a spine chiller.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Umesh who has lost interest in scholastics is similarly dumbfounded with regards to seeking after his filmmaking aspirations. At the point when pretty young lady Daisy moves in to his area, an affection struck Umesh tells his companions that they are a couple. Expecting that he might need to join the privately-run company after flopping in all subjects, Umesh flees to Chennai, just to discover Daisy on the train. A photograph clicked with her territories him in desperate waterways and his life goes in a different direction.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Nivin Pauly illuminates the screen with his bubbling and takes each scene, playing the loser Umesh. However his peculiarities help one to remember &#8216;Rameshan&#8217; in 1983 who gives scholastics a secondary lounge for the love of cricket, the entertainer&#8217;s shenanigans don&#8217;t neglect to engage. Numerous discoursed mouthed by Aju&#8217;s sidekick character and Vineeth&#8217;s investigator for hire symbol are created with accuracy to inspire chuckling.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Post span, notwithstanding, the account wobbles when it wears the clothing of an investigator thrill ride, however Aju&#8217;s tricks offer some lighthearted element. The story wrecks from what it headed out to be and it appears to be like the chief didn&#8217;t have the foggiest idea where to take his characters to. One can&#8217;t resist the urge to consider what was truly going on with the film as the credits begin moving post the tangled, sudden peak. Oru Vadakkan Selfie merits a watch for the presentation of its lively cast and numerous snapshots of mind they pull off easily.</span>
