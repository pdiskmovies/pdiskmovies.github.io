    <span>Three small-time criminals soak up a suggestion to rob one of the biggest jewellery stores within the city. Will they be successful of their try, given that the store’s owner, a ruthless man, is privy to the plan?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: Rajathandhiram starts offevolved with the sale of a bike. Two searching for what you offer approach the guy who wants to promote the bike. The mechanic whom one in all them has introduced additionally jumps into the fray while he hears the price. Soon, one guy will pay for it and takes it domestic. But while he comes out to expose it to his circle of relatives members, the motorbike is gone. And, then, we see that the other three gamers we noticed in the previous scene are all friends. They are con artists and that they have correctly staged a con. In the voice over, Arjun, the mastermind behind the plot tells us that they&#8217;re now not cheating all and sundry but exploiting the greed of others to make some money. We at once think about Sathuranka Vettai, whose hero, too, operated on this identical precept. In a couple of minutes, we get a scene involving a MLM assembly and our fears of a retread most effective increase.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But then, Rajathandhiram well-knownshows itself to be a completely unique movie. Arjun and his friends Deva and Kullan are approached by way of Madhavan Iyer, their go-to-man, who wants them to rob the jewelry store of Azhagappan, a large shot jeweler within the town, for his friend Dharma. They to start with lower back out, and Arjun even goes to Azhagappan and informs him of the plan, however give in when they research the real motive in the back of Dharma’s request. And for this reason starts an interesting recreation of double and triple crossing that keeps us on the edge of our seat till the stop.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Making a heist movie is as problematic as pulling a heist for the entirety relies upon on timing. With Rajathandhiram, AG Amid has controlled to carry out the trick very convincingly — the filmmaking is quite nimble and assured that it&#8217;s miles tough to believe that this is the work of a debutant director. This is most obtrusive at some stage in a pre-c program languageperiod con scene that takes location in a resort. The protagonists are pressured to live on their feet and scouse borrow a bag and in fact, even the actual heist fails to come back close to this one’s nerve-wracking anxiety.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Amid takes his time to introduce the various gamers, their motives and their relationships. Then, he simply lays out the heist plan and expertly spins a web of deceit and cunning. He additionally manages to introduce a romantic angle to this tale that now not simplest feels out of vicinity however additionally will become one of the reasons for the heist to take location.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The fake notes occur within the remaining quantities whilst Arjun begins to develop a sense of right and wrong and the movie does lose a piece of area. A hero doesn’t always need to be lawful and as long as what he does is morally right, he&#8217;s going to usually endear himself to the target audience. There is a purpose why Danny Ocean doesn’t surrender his methods; he&#8217;ll turn into a person that is less amusing. Even the specified account of why Dharma wants to degree the heist isn’t needed. He desires to take revenge on Azhagappan is all that we need to get emotionally involved in the heist, and the flashback makes it appear overtly sentimental, particularly in a movie this cool. Also, the way wherein Azhagappan’s son-in-regulation behaves after he comes to know of the reality is much less convincing.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But those are just niggles, for there may be a lot to respect inside the relaxation of the movie, from SR Kathir’s fluid cinematography to Praveen Antony’s dexterous modifying and Sandeep Chowta’s understated rating. The actors, too, are apt. Veera moves the right tone as a clean operator and Darbuka Siva’s timely zingers are a hoot. And, it is usually an awesome aspect whilst we get a heroine who can emote and can speak Tamil with out making it look like miming. We surprise why Regina doesn’t get more possibilities here.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Even smaller characters are quirky and convincing — like the laidback inspector, who keeps reining in his demanding subordinate while coping with the heist. But it is Pattiyal Sekar, who&#8217;s the wonder package deal. As Azhagappan, he may be very powerful in conveying quiet threat. We are simply into the 0.33 month of the year but relaxation confident, Rajathandhiram will actually find an area the various quality movies of the 12 months.</span>
