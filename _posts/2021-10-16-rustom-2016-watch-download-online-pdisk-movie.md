    Rustom Pavri (Akshay Kumar), a respectable official of the Indian Navy shoots his companion Vikram (Arjan Bajwa) to death subsequent to finding that his better half Cynthia (Ileana D&#8217;Cruz) had an unsanctioned romance with the rich financial specialist. The Commander gives up himself to the Police promptly and concedes to have killed Vikram however argues &#8216;not liable&#8217; in court. Is it true that he is sentenced or vindicated?&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Audit: Though the peak has been astutely fictionalized, this court dramatization is basically founded on the genuine of Naval official Kâ€‰M Nanavati, who in 1959, shot and killed his significant other&#8217;s sweetheart. The ensuing preliminary was one of India&#8217;s most shocking legal disputes.&nbsp;

  <div>
    Going to the film, Rustom has a wafer of a start. Without burning through any time, the chief comes directly forthright. He takes us rapidly through the conditions wherein Rustom shoots Vikram and the preliminary starts.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Akshay Kumar is the foundation of Rustom. The Khiladi renders one of the most downplayed exhibitions of his profession, demonstrating once more that he can play a scope of different jobs easily. He easily pulls off his person without any difficulty.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    In view of a disputable case, Rustom does not have the alarming pressure one in a perfect world anticipates from a film of this class. Nonetheless, chief Tinu Suresh Desai imbues sufficient drama and ups the interest. Ileana D&#8217;Cruz is impeccably projected and finishes equity to her job. Arjan Bajwa is respectable also.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    To get to the point, Rustom can be looked for its story and in particular Akshay Kumar, whose activity/comic brightness frequently eclipses his acting ability. He reminds you to esteem the legit officials who serve our country with nobility and boldness. He makes you need to help the one who likely did the correct thing incorrectly.
