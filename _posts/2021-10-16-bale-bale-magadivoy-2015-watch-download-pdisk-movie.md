    <span>Forgetful Lucky (Nani) falls in love with the demure Nandana (Lavanya Tripathi). But she doesn’t realize he has hassle remembering matters and her dad does!</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: Maruthi shook off the tag of being a “Boothu cinema professional” (movies loaded with double entendre, for the uninitiated) with Kotha Janta last year. And with Bhale Bhale Magadivoi, he has reinstated that he desires to exchange not just human beings’s perceptions however additionally the manner he makes movies.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Story clever, Bhale Bhale Magadivoi is quite simple and simple. But it is the interesting treatment of the tale and smooth comedy that accompanies it which makes this movie a fun trip. The exceptional forgetful Lucky (Nani) suffers from a weird situation because of which he tends to overlook what he is doing usually – if he asked you to stay on keep at the cellphone, don’t be surprised when you have to stay on hold till the decision gets disconnected because he ought to have moved on to some thing else already – falls in love with the quite, harmless and unassuming Nandana (Lavanya Tripathi). He maintains getting embroiled in hilarious conditions thanks to his absent mindedness and that makes this movie well worth the time. In reality, the lady doesn’t even realize his forgetfulness due to the fact for a genuinely long term he manages to cover up so tactfully each time he&#8217;s caught in the act.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In the midst of their tale is Nandana’s dad (Murli Sharma) who has an idea approximately Lucky’s unlucky ‘disability’. So the disguise and are trying to find that ensues, results in a sea of histrionics that shape a comedy of mistakes.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>With references to films like Attarintiki Daaredi, Munnabhai MBBS and Basha including to the a laugh scenes, it&#8217;s far well worth appreciating Maruthi’s knack for making comedy work. It could be very unexpected that there’s just one connection with some sexual element – that too it comes and goes so casually that it doesn’t come off as offensive. Add to that, his story could be very fresh with interesting references to yesteryear songs, and there’s laughter that comes to you really. The film is a great package deal with the proper blend of comedy, romance, feelings and movement.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Maruthi is aptly supported by way of Nani who excels in his act. Be it his confusion – which many will relate to – or his spontaneity which makes you guffaw greater frequently than not. Why he&#8217;s referred to as ‘herbal celebrity’ in the film’s titles is proven to you with instance throughout the movie.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Lavanya because the smitten lover and the loving daughter is a deal with to observe. Given clever selections profession smart, she has the ability to grow to be a performer who will leave a mark with every overall performance of hers. It’s no longer simply her seems but her grace and ease which can be her property. Murli Sharma has a full-fledged performance this is pinnacle-notch. However, Ajay seems uncomfortable as the police officer seeking to woo Nandana. Naresh and Sitara are in their detail too.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The movie’s soul is its heritage rating which gives every element an upheaval. Gopi Sundar additionally creates a few exciting tunes although a number of them are killed with the aid of unnecessary placement and strange picturisation.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But then, the film has a glitch in the truth that the hero doesn’t make any attempt to ease his existence (it&#8217;s far the arena of technology and you can actually without difficulty plan things on line, set alarms, reminders and what no longer!). Add to that, the film slowly transitions into a predictable mode in the direction of the climax which is slightly contrived, brief and handy.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But regardless of that, this movie comes across as a breath of fresh air as it efficiently keeps itself away from the normal components of romantic comedies with out the oh-so-overused clichés and is a pleasure for anybody looking for healthy enjoyment.</span>
