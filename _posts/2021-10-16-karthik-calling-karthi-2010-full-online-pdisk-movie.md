    <span>Karthik, the notorious failure, would have passed his life undetected yet for the call which changed his life one early morn. The guest, additionally calling himself Karthik, shows our legend how to land the top position, the hottie, the incident life, until our saint infuriates him&#8230;Is it downhill get-togethers?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Survey: Rock On, Luck By Chance and presently Karthik Calling Karthik&#8230;seriously folks, Farhan Akhtar is ending up being a disclosure as an entertainer. As Karthik, the 3D shape livestock (read office no one) who carries on with a dreary life in a dull house accomplishing boring work, he is totally shocking. His agony at being undetected, taken advantage of and crushed by one and all &#8211; both in his own and expert life &#8211; hits you like a heavy hammer. As does his chutzpah, when he metamorphoses into the other, more smart and socially proficient Karthik who might be the overall quite safe person yet certainly not the exhausting person. Then, at that point, it is his tranquil certainty and delicate hostility that cause you to sit up and watch, as he approaches vanquishing the very universes that had before overlooked him. Treat.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>However, there&#8217;s a third symbol too that Farhan exhibits with equivalent felicity. In the wake of winning over the young lady who hadn&#8217;t saw him over the most recent couple of years and turning into an equivalent accomplice in the achievement of the organization where he works, presently that he&#8217;s constrained his khadoos manager to recognize his achievements, Karthik&#8217;s life abruptly takes a turn downhill. His coach, the other, mysterious telephone guest Karthik, gets enraged when his personality is uncovered and takes steps to turn mean. He ruins all his painstakingly sustained connections and sends poor people, criticized soul into stowing away by and by. This time round, the secrecy is much more agonizing, as KO-ed Karthik attempts to return his life, piece by piece, less his underhanded guide. Does it work?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It does, at one level. Vijay Lalwani&#8217;s film is enormously watchable, only for the example of true excellence by Farhan Akhtar in the lead spot. Indeed, even Deepika Padukone contributes consummately as the cheeky, uptown young lady who has consumed her fingers a bit excessively, as do the periphery players like Ram Kapoor and Shefali Chayya. One wishes there was a bit a greater amount of the effervescent Ms Padukone, however. Where it doesn&#8217;t work is the diversion factor. The screenplay will in general get a bit cumbersome and the show fairly substantial as the chief searches for reading material goals of the prodding issue. In any case, overall, there is a rush factor that keeps the force on.</span>
