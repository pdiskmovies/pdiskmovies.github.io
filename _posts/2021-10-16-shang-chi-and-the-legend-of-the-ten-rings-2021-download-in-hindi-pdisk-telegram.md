&nbsp;<span>There was a point in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings when I failed to remember I was watching a Marvel film. It&#8217;s odd to say that perhaps the greatest strength of this most recent Marvel flick is the way un-Marvel it is, yet perhaps it&#8217;s fitting that a film about conflicting character has its very own double personality. Opening on the big screen today, Sept. 3, Shang-Chi accompanies Marvel qualities and shortcomings from opening fight to inevitable post-credits scene, while likewise feeling like something winningly new. </span>

<span>In contrast to July&#8217;s Black Widow, this most recent Marvel experience will not stream on Disney Plus (basically until October). Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings debuts just in theaters. Really look at your neighborhood direction and follow COVID safety measures to defend your wellbeing in case you&#8217;re considering seeing this or some other movie in a theater. </span>

<span>Simu Liu plays Shaun, an adorable goof wasting his life in San Francisco parking vehicles and doing karaoke with his mate Katy, played by Awkwafina. But his name is truly Shang-Chi and he&#8217;s really trained to be an assassin by his centuries old warlord father, who appears with an arrangement to vanquish a supernatural town stowed away somewhere down in a Chinese woods. </span>

<span>The film is conveyed by Hong Kong cinema legend Tony Leung as Wenwu, patriarch to both Shang-Chi and a shadowy ninja armed force. Leung is massively compelling as a villain who&#8217;s by turns steely or heartfelt, loving or retribution driven. Wenwu is one of the most nuanced and intriguing bad guys of any new blockbuster, not to mention the Marvel franchise. </span>

<span>I mostly failed to remember Shang-Chi was essential for the Disney-possessed comic book-based franchise in view of how little it depends on association with the more extensive MCU. In any event, when Marvel recently introduced new characters to the big screen, similar to Black Panther, Ant-Man or the MCU variant of Spider-Man, they tended to cover with other movies. However that is fun in its own specific manner, it&#8217;s truly refreshing to watch a film stand completely on its own two feet, without watchers having to recollect other movies. And indeed, I like that is a low bar, however hello, that is the spin-off/spinoff/reboot culture we live in. </span>

<span>Alright, so there are gestures to the previous MCU. Without going into spoilers, these gestures are OK since you don&#8217;t need to recall a muddled origin story, they bode well, and in particular they&#8217;re interesting.</span>
