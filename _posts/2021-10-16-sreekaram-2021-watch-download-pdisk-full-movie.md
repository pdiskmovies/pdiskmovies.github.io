## Sreekaram (2021) movie review

<div>
  <div>
    <span>Telugu film&#8217;s tryst with the cultivating emergency is a well established wonder and there&#8217;s no lack of movies that depict legends as savior to the ranchers. Sharwanand starrer Sreekaram is the furthest down the line expansion to this association; be that as it may, what separates it is the means by which established it is and how the legend deals with address the issue. It reveals to us that cultivating can be productive as well, and that the adolescent should lead the way by viewing at cultivating as some other occupation. The accentuation on pride of work is omnipresent in the film and it has a compelling passionate center that strikes the right harmony. However, the narrating itself needs punch and the story crashes and burns, despite the fact that it prevails with regards to passing on the message.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Sreekaram is the narrative of Karthik (Sharwanand), an adolescent who functions as a programmer in Hyderabad. His folks live in a little town close to Tirupati and his dad is very glad for his achievements. His companion, Chaitra (Priyanka Arul Mohan) is profoundly infatuated with him and needs to wed him. Regardless of this, Karthik has his very own arrangement &#8211; he needs to be a rancher. The remainder of the story is regarding what happens when he breaks the news at home.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>There&#8217;s a lovely line in the film where Karthik states that the vast majority return to their towns just on two events &#8211; celebrations and passings. The remainder of the time, the houses are totally locked and with the exception of a couple of individuals, nobody stays in the town in light of the fact that there&#8217;s with lots but idle time. Cultivating isn&#8217;t productive any longer and the obligations keep stacking up a seemingly endless amount of many years. Sreekaram gives us an obvious rude awakening about existence in the open country, and how a great many people go to urban communities and do unspecialized temp jobs to earn enough to pay the rent. At the point when Karthik finds what his uncle does in the city, it breaks him. In another occurrence, another resident regrets that he can&#8217;t deal with his mom notwithstanding working in the city since he&#8217;s so bustling constantly. Chief Kishore comes clean with us in the easiest of terms, without transforming it into a message regarding how life in a town is better contrasted with urban areas. The dread of broke dreams and obligations get individuals far from their foundations.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span></p> 
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The film is apparently motivated from a few genuine stories where individuals have returned to cultivating and found achievement as well. It drives home the message that the sky is the limit if individuals stay joined together and utilize current techniques while developing their properties. No issues up until now. Simultaneously, Sreekaram feels boring since nothing exceptional occurs in the story. The contention and the show in the story are quelled generally, and it pivots an excessive lot on the genuineness that Sharwanand brings to the screen. The procedures get a bit too unsurprising and the actual show feels like a TED Talk which a fruitful business person would give regarding how he had an effect.&nbsp;
      </p>

    <p>
      </span></div> 
      
      <div>
        <span>Yet, there&#8217;s something surprisingly legit concerning what Sreekaram needs to say and its passionate subtext, particularly that of the holding among Karthik and his dad Keshavulu (Rao Ramesh), is very much depicted. Sharwanand sparkles as the benevolent youngster who needs to reward the town which has formed his character. His discussions with Rao Ramesh, who is the enthusiastic anchor in the film, are among the best portions in the story. Priyanka Arul Mohan, who plays Sharwanand&#8217;s heartfelt interest, has a decent screen presence and has her influence with a lot of extravagance, regardless of whether her job feels unidimensional. Sai Kumar gets a substantial job as a cash loan specialist, whose avarice and desire ruins many lives, and he pros the job.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>Eventually, you notice the sincere goals and the trustworthiness with which Sreekaram needs to bring the cultivating emergency and the condition of towns to the front line. It tracks down a basic answer for the issue and discloses to us life opens a lot of entryways for us, in the event that we have the will to lean on our instinct. It doesn&#8217;t attempt to do anything momentous as far as narrating, however at that point it has sufficient passionate heave to view the subject in a serious way.</span>
