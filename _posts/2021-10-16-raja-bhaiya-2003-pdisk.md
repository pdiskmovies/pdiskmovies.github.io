      <span>Right Image Films P. Ltd.&#8217;s RAJA BHAIYA is crucial for both, director Raman Kumar and actor Govinda. The project not only means a lot to a director making a comeback after almost a decade, but also to an actor whose acting career isn&#8217;t going great guns.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span><br />But, unfortunately, neither is the director&#8217;s comeback memorable, nor does the actor&#8217;s precariously hanging career find solid ground.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span><br />Raja [Govinda] is a small-town guy who has taken an oath to remain a brahmachari, thanks to a guru. On the other hand, Pratibha [Aarti Chhabria] is a happy-go-lucky youngster, who, as per the will, will become the rightful owner of the property when she turns 21.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span><br />Unfortunately, just on her birthday, she meets with an accident while driving. She survives the crash, but goes blank about her past. This amnesiac Pratibha is brought home by Raja&#8217;s mother.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span><br />Raja tries all tricks in the books to get rid of her, but fails. Things take a turn when his mother announces his marriage to Pratibha. Unable to turn down her word, he unwillingly marries her.</span>
