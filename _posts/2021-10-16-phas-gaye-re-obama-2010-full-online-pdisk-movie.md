    <span>From the Big Apple to the backwaters of unassuming community India, this parody of blunders lives and breathes fire through its brilliant characters and its clever screenplay. Dissimilar to the typical average comedies which Bollywood blossoms with, Phas Gaye&#8230; makes you giggle in light of its goofy circumstances, as opposed to evoke canned chuckling by making individuals slip over banana strips, go filthy or hit and squeeze each other madly. On the off chance that Om Shastri is a scheming wheeler-seller from Amreeka, Bhaisaheb (Sanjay Mishra) is the neighborhood dada who is impeded by the &#8216;mandee&#8217; (recession) in his business of coercion and hijacking. Yeh mandee aaye kahan se? (Where has this recession come from) he asks his cohorts. From Amreeka, they reply and figure out how to interface their wrongdoing and discipline diagram to the going-ons in world legislative issues: the injury of Obama, the destiny of Saddam, the goof-ups of Bush. What&#8217;s more, it isn&#8217;t Bhaisaheb alone however his entire biradari (fellowship) of bhai-log (little clock Manu Rishi, Lady Gabbar Neha Dhupia, slanted legislator Amol Gupte) who appear to influenced by the financial emergency in Obama&#8217;s regime.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Staggering exhibitions, sensitive humor and a stunt and-treat plot line: Phas Gaye Re Obama is a magnificent year&#8217;s end shock bundle. After immense catastrophes like Chandni Chowk to China, Warner Inc appears to have realized that little &#8211; yet shrewd &#8211; is genuinely lovely.&nbsp;</span>
