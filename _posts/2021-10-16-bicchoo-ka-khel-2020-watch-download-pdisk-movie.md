    <span>REVIEW: Set in Banaras, ‘Bicchoo Ka Khel’ revolves round&nbsp; people, Babu (Mukul Chadda) and his son Akhil Shrivastav. In the sunlight hours, the duo works in ‘Chaubey Mishthan Bhandar’ run by way of Mukesh Chaubey (Rajesh Sharma) even as night time transforms them into small-time thieves. On a fateful night, Babu goes right into a vacant residence for burglary and soon enough, he receives arrested for the homicide of neighborhood goon — Munna Singh (Gautam Babbar). One factor results in some other and Babu is observed lifeless in prison. Akhil believes that his father changed into framed and murdered so he decided to uncover the reality.</span>

    <span>Based on Amit Khan’s novel of the same call, this collection kick starts with Akhil shooting noted advocate and social worker, Anil Chaubey (Satyajit Sharma), in front of a live target market during university competition. After killing him, Akhil surrenders to the police and his interrogation scenes supply a sneak-top into the lives of various characters who have pass path with the vengeful guy.</span>

    <span>From the start, director Ashish R Shukla leaves no stone unturned in retaining this crime thriller engrossing. There is a total of nine episodes with a period of 20-23mins every and all are stacked with enough twists and turns. Sunil Pillai’s cinematography is commendable and the screenplay via Ghalib Asad Bhopali and Gibran Noorani is fast-paced. It’s engaging to the level that whenever you feel you&#8217;re in the direction of the truth; it takes a brand new flip and tells you there’s tons more waiting ahead. However, occasionally, the tempo at which the narrative is headed makes it tough for the visitors to connect the dots. Another setback for ‘Bicchoo Ka Khel’ is its climax —may also come off as disappointing to many. The initial build-up is extraordinarily powerful and maintains you glued, but the massive reveal in itself isn’t all that explosive.</span>

    <span>Some of the dialogues with the aid of Kshitij Roy are witty, as an example, “boyfriend hain cleaning soap detergent nahi, ki pehle istemaal kare fir vishwas kare.” In addition to that, its heritage song pushes the storyline ahead and the inclusion of traditional songs from the 80’s — ‘Aao Na Gaale Laga Lo Na’, ‘Dhanno Ki Aankhon Mein’, — that deserve unique point out here.</span>

  <div>
    <span>Fans of Divyenndu Sharma aka Munna Bhaiya from Mirzapur will not be disheartened along with his act as Akhil Shrivastav. He is lower back with a bang – mouthing dialogues encumbered with cuss words, his expressions and comedian timing is simply superb. Anshul Chauhan as his female friend Rashmi Chaubey has nailed it. Her chemistry with Divyenndu is endearing and turns out to be one of the highlights of the show. Rajesh Sharma along with his on-screen spouse Protima (played by way of Trishna Mukherjee) also upload to the crime-mystery with their measured, reliable acts.</span>

  <div>
    <span>Keeping up with the vibe of the 80’s golden era of Indian cinema, ‘Bicchoo Ka Khel’ has the whole thing—from hero-heroine ka pyaar and gundas to dhamakedar actions and complex songs. With all the components intact, this revenge saga begins on a promising observe but turns out to be an average watch later.</span>
