    <span>Audit: Sameer is a normal understudy concentrating to turn into a specialist in a Hyderabad inn. After a progression of bomb impacts in the city, he is caught in an ATS attack by the specialists who are searching for his flat mate, the tricky Yasin Darji who is supposed to be the driving force behind the impacts. ATS boss Vikram Desai torments the adolescent and separates him to utilize him for &#8216;everyone&#8217;s benefit&#8217;.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>By all accounts, &#8216;Sameer&#8217; is a rigid spine chiller that ganders at how the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) in India capacities when confronted with fear based oppressor dangers, chiefly Islamic radicalism. It shows us how automatic responses in the more elite classes of the security foundation influence individuals in the city. Equitably, it uncovers the political hardware in a country which utilizes foundations of capacity for their own potential benefit by adjusting public discernment. The disclaimer toward the beginning of the film goes on for just about brief where the producers guarantee us that they are not making the film to affront anybody. An hour into the film, you see exactly why they needed.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Sameer is an appropriate edge-of-the-seat spine chiller, yet with its blemishes, however keeps you snared till the end with an exceptionally solid result. However, the best part is the manner in which the movie producer has minced no words. No ideological group, religion or organization is let free by chief Dakxin Chhara and the outcome is a tense, low-spending thrill ride which is absolutely worth your time and energy. Exhibitions might be the Achilles&#8217; Heel of Sameer, yet a solid story and a bold goal make it a decent watch. Know those little movies which appear suddenly and rival the big deal on the strength of their substance? This equitable could be one of them.</span>
