          <span>A crazy two-hander that twists an entire bundle of Bollywood rules, AK vs AK is unclassifiable admission. For comfort, let us call it is a mockumentary where a prisoner spine chiller meets a foolish escapade that turns constantly in a way that we didn&#8217;t know was inside the domains of probability in a Hindi film.&nbsp;</span>

          <span>The film opens in a veteran celebrity&#8217;s vanity van. A &#8216;persona non grata&#8217; chief sneaks in and proposes an unusual thought for a film. It&#8217;s the entertainer&#8217;s birthday and he is late for a family get-together. Yet, the petitioner is in no mind-set to take no for an answer. That is correctly what AK vs AK resembles: so way-out that it has no off limits regions.&nbsp;</span>

          <span>The Netflix unique movie, coordinated by Vikramaditya Motwane, obscures the line among the real world and fiction. Suffering Hindi celebrity Anil Kapoor (AK) and autonomous film nonconformist Anurag Kashyap (AK) play themselves and take swipes at one another in a trippy entertainer chief tussle that is, in every practical sense, a stretched out in-joke. The activity unfurls over the span of one evening &#8211; December 24, Kapoor&#8217;s birthday.&nbsp;</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="separator">
          <span>The rollercoaster experience, recorded fly-on-the-divider style, fixates on the hijacking of Kapoor&#8217;s little girl Sonam (who shows up alongside sibling Harshvardhan, who mourns the mischief Motwane&#8217;s BhaveshJoshi Superhero has done to his profession and expectations Kashyap will assist with switching his fortunes with Bhavesh Joshi 2).&nbsp;</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="separator">
          <span>Kashyap, a chief embarrassed in broad daylight by Kapoor, is out to dole out retributions. He invokes a content that includes a test of skill and endurance to discover and protect the prisoner before dawn, all to be shot progressively. Kapoor is alongside himself with rage yet the peril that his girl is in urges him to cooperate.&nbsp;</span>

          <span>AK vs AK is a wild, odd roll of the dice. It might have been a catastrophe had the minds behind it didn&#8217;t have the foggiest idea what they were facing. That positively isn&#8217;t the situation. The film&#8217;s mindfulness verges on the faltering.</span>
