    <span>Purba (Raima Sen), a psychiatrist with the aid of career, witnesses a bomb blast in her town. The trauma reveals some darkish secrets from her beyond.

    <span>What defines a nicely-made psychological thriller? Is it the intricacy of plot? An detail of surprise? Excellent performances? Or the surprising twist in the long run? It&#8217;s a chunk of all and though Tollywood does not produce too many of those movies, Manoj Michgan’s 89 is an sincere attempt with a gripping storyline, a terrific script and smart making.</span>

    <span>The non-linear storyline works nicely right here, as we get a glimpse into Purba’s stricken past and the way her unsure gift is tormented by a chilly-blooded killer, Sabyasachi. As the mystery unravels, Sabyasachi’s individual is revealed regularly — from a clean-speakme man to a moody and calculative fiend. The director maintains the audience guessing approximately his intentions. The fine element is, there are no useless songs or tear-jerking melodrama to dilute the anxiety that holds accurate thru the movie.</span>

    <span>With its lonely corridors, creepy alleys, darkish cells and more, 89 is fairly paying homage to moody mental thrillers from Hollywood and Asian cinema. The 2nd half of flags a bit though and you could second-guess the killer&#8217;s intentions — no longer a incredible advertisement for the movie&#8217;s genre allegiance. However, there isn’t a unmarried unfastened string within the plot that the director forgets to tie up at the stop. The performances — Raima along with her huge eyes and an air of vulnerability, Shataf along with his road smartness and clever demeanour and most importantly, Saswata along with his diffused but bone-chilling cruelty — also make this movie worth an eye fixed.</span>
