    <span>Wonderful World seems like a present day-day half of-baked riff on Charles Dickens&#8217; A Christmas Carol. Despite a movie competition pedigree (it became proven at some of nearby gala&#8217;s on the 2009 circuit), the film is so light-weight and inconsequential that a review appears nearly superfluous. You recognise the way it goes: the terrible excuse for a individual experiences a religious re-awakening and sees the arena in a special mild. Although the story is derivative and not entirely credible, the primary hassle germinates from unconvincing performances. A woefully miscast Matthew Broderick headlines a group of actors who&#8217;ve completed right matters in the past however are left rudderless in veteran screenwriter Joshua Goldin&#8217;s directorial debut. Cheesy accents and lame speak abound. Wonderful World&#8217;s issues are actually conveyed, and the film avoids what could have been an unbearably cloying ending, however an excessive amount of of what&#8217;s on display feels forced and unnatural.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Ben Singer (Matthew Broderick) is a currently divorced, center-elderly man who works as a proofreader and shares his rental with a roommate, Ibu (Michael K. Williams). Ibu, who joins his cohabitator in playing chess and smoking joints, is the closest aspect Ben has to a pal. This way of life is a come-down for someone who turned into once a successful performer of kid&#8217;s songs. Ben is a sour, unsightly misanthrope. His teenage daughter, Sandra (Jodelle Ferland), reveals her times along with her father to be so intolerable that she now not desires to spend nights or weekends in his custody and invents excuses to deny him his courtroom-appointed rights. The chip on Ben&#8217;s shoulder is made extra suggested by using his marijuana-induced visions of &#8220;The Man&#8221; (Philip Baker Hall), who lectures him on the bias of lifestyles.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>One day, Ibu goes into a diabetic coma and is hospitalized. His sister, Khadi (Sanaa Lathan), arrives from Senegal to be at his aspect. Ben invitations her to live with him and, in a relatively perfunctory style, the 2 fall in love. For some time, this improves Ben&#8217;s disposition and Khadi&#8217;s have an effect on coaxes sufficient humanity from his soul for him to share a few great moments along with his daughter. But has she wormed herself into Ben&#8217;s affections and bed due to the fact she cares for him or because he is her first-class bet for acquiring a green card?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In a extraordinary kind of manner, Wonderful World recalls The Visitor, the underneath-the-radar 2007 film starring Richard Jenkins as a person who rediscovers his humanity when he connects with&nbsp; squatters living in his New York rental. Yet, as plausible as Jenkins&#8217; transformation changed into, it is how tough it&#8217;s miles to swallow the second one-price spiritual adventure undertaken through Ben. Perhaps the real problem with Wonderful World evoking memories of The Visitor is that, even in an oblique contrast, the inferiority of Goldin&#8217;s attempt is apparent. The Visitor provoked a actual emotional response; Wonderful World consists of yeast that never rises.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Broderick, who has come a long way given that Ferris Bueller (the role for which he is nevertheless great regarded) is a bad fit for Ben. In seeking to mask his natural boyish allure, Broderick overplays the man or woman&#8217;s nastiness to a stage that processes cool animated film. I failed to for a moment believe in this character. Broderick doesn&#8217;t deserve sole credit for torpedoing Ben; he&#8217;s saddled with horrible communicate and the timing is so poor in intended comedic scenes that even mild chuckles are not likely. One almost feels sorry for the charismatic Saana Lathan (Love & Basketball, Something New), who makes a recreation try and salvage something from her interracial relationship with Broderick, but the lack of chemistry defeats her. Poor Michael K. Williams (one of the stars of the TV collection The Wire) spends most of the film unconscious. A vibrant spot is supplied through young Jodelle Ferland, whose scenes with Broderick are the only ones that ring actual.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>I assume Wonderful World will be considered a &#8220;experience excellent&#8221; movement photograph, however it&#8217;s the kind of film in which the upbeat finishing doesn&#8217;t entirely justify the soreness of having there. The direction and writing are basically TV-movie-of-the-week nice. The revel in is so unremarkable that spending any money on it&#8217;s far overly generous. A paying purchaser may be forgiven for feeling that he isn&#8217;t always getting his money&#8217;s worth.</span>
