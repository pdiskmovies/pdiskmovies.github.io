  <div>
    <span>A little boy desires of nothing but cricket and his doting dad can visit any extent to make his son’s reputedly impossible dream come actual. Even if it method stealing Tendulkar’s crimson-hot Ferrari for in the future of his life.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Vroom! Vroom! It’s time to move zoom! Rev up those engines and flip up that rapid firepower for a experience on ‘560 horses’ (as the Ferrari’s horsepower is cutely stated in this squeaky clean, purple metallic agency). Made for all boys, who never definitely develop up, and all youngsters who aspire to develop into the revered boots of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. And not anything is greater aspirational than a sparkling crimson Ferrari – the precise same one owned by way of the Little Master himself. A automobile that grows past its phallic symbolism, psychologists confer with, and stays the dream toy of all massive boys. The better to bait them with, my dear.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The bait here&#8217;s a boy’s huge dream, of being every other Sachin someday. Kayo (Ritvik Sahore) is a budding cricketer, with capability to play extra than gully cricket. Rusy (Sharman Joshi), a unmarried father, with a modest job (as head clerk at Worli RTO), instantly-laced, painfully honest with Raja Harishchandra-like characteristics, has one goal – to fulfil his little boy’s dream. With a grin pinned on his face (brighter and shinier than a Ferrari at instances) through all weather, he’s prepared to take on the world (of cops, thugs, wedding ceremony planners, and our very own Tendulkar). Kayo qualifies for a education camp at the Mecca of cricket, Lords, but there’s a hitch in this pitch. Damn the skills, he wishes to cough up large moolah for it. Mota Papa (Boman Irani), Rusy’s haggard and hopeless father &#8211; who’s lamenting a tragedy that’s modified the sport of his lifestyles – dissuades them from using a unnecessary, fancier-than-a-Ferrari dream.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In the in the meantime, a nearby wedding planner (Seema Pahawa) has over-promised a thug politician a sawaari on pink-warm wheels, for his nincompoop son’s baraat. And simplest Rusy can bail her out of this mess, together with his cricket ka rishta, which steeps deep into his genes. Once the imply machine hits the street, all hell breaks free, all regulations are damaged and thereon, starts a dream run that would even placed Schumacher to disgrace.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>This indeed, signals a new innings in Sharman Joshi’s profession. His performance is coronary heart-warming, shuffling between light-hearted moments and tear-jerking feelings. Young Ritvik, like a true captain, holds the crew together. This little stock of talent is so herbal and expressive, he’ll bowl you over.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Boman Irani, with his Parsi nuances, hunchback, slur, and a beautiful play of emotions starting from despondency to exuberance, supplies a smashing performance. Paresh Rawal, in a small function, ‘catches’ you, proper on. Satyadeep Misra (teach Vilayat) and Seema Pahawa score huge with their first rate helping acts.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Sometimes, it doesn’t take eleven gamers to make a dream crew. Debutant director, Rajesh Mapuskar, has a triumphing group with simply 3, plus a pink hottie (Ferrari of direction, we’re no longer speaking approximately boombaat Balan). And bet what&#8230;We don’t miss the presence of a pretty ‘maiden’ right here too. The spirit of the film is inside the effusive chemistry between Rusy and his son, which is enjoyable and utterly transferring. The writing (Mapuskar and Vidhu Vinod Chopra) is refreshing, Raju Hirani gives the dialogues his trademark spin, and the film unfolds with sheer subtlety and simplicity. Except that, the experience may want to’ve been shorter (jumping a few red signals might’ve helped), and a few speed bumps stored (a song with a flying purple automobile). The climax is going on an emotional overdrive, and at instances, with more spoonfuls of sugar the film is simply too-good-to-be-true. But that’s feel exact cinema for you!</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>What tosses in its favour is the individuality of the concept (so what if you neglected a trip with the real Sachin in his laal gaddi). Look on the brighter facet of lifestyles, dikra.</span>
