    <span>Prem (Salman Khan) falls in love with runaway bride Sanjana (Asin) who masquerades as a circle of relatives visitor and takes refuge in his amazing Indian parivaar. But before he can marry her, he have to kind out her family issues and rework her warring extended family into an archetypal Hum Saath Saath Hain own family too. Time for motion, drama and some low brow humour&#8230;.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: It&#8217;s tough to understand why Anees Bazmee makes films. There generally is no common sense to it&#8230; Thank You, No Problem&#8230; But however, it&#8217;s easy to apprehend why Anees Bazmee makes films: to rejoice the illogical and the non-sensical which will be healing for a excessive-strain audience. Ready, mercifully, has every other purpose too: Salman Khan. The movie is an unabashed ode to Salman Khan, the entertainer instead of the actor. And sure, it really works at that degree. Sit again for a one-guy display with the aid of an actor who is turning into increasingly unapologetic about his larger-than-lifestyles picture on display and you&#8217;ll get all of the bang for your buck you choice.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>So you have got Salman doing the whole thing he likes to do &#8212; and you like to see. He talks in tacky dialogues, breaks into rumbustious, and extraordinarily well choreographed songs and dances, romances the lady in brazen fashion, turns into the invincible hit gadget each time desired, by no means let&#8217;s cross of his popular circle of relatives boy avatar (recall the unique Prem of Maine Pyaar Kiya) and attempts to make you snicker through always gambling it over the pinnacle. And sure, he does do what he is supposed to do: gets rid of his blouse, bares his flawlessly sculpted frame and vainly asks `mazaa aaya kya?&#8217;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Yup, bahut mazaa aaya. But most effective if you set apart all pretensions of going for a normal, thoughts-teaser film. The relaxation of the characters too are all a crazy bunch. The umpteen guys, women and boys &#8212; you lose matter of them &#8212; communicate stupid, communicate shrieky. The tune (Pritam) performs at deafening decibel degrees. The canvas and the colors of the movie are garish and loud. And there is not a second of repose to will let you think&#8230;.</span>
