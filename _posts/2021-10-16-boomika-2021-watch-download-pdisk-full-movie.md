    <span>Boomika starts with a mishap that occurs close to Nagapattinam. A man is addressing his pregnant spouse over telephone when blast, a truck hits his vehicle and he passes on. The activity then, at that point, movements to Pudhumandhu town in Ooty, where we are acquainted with the primary players. Gautham (Vidhu) is at the slope station with his therapist spouse Samyuktha (Aishwarya Rajesh) and child Sidhu to start work on a land project for a pastor. They are joined by his companion Gayathri (Surya Ganapathy), a planner who Gautham has welcome to assist with his undertaking, and Arthi (Madhuri), his sister. They go to his palatial chateau in a far off domain, where, very soon, frightful things start to occur. Like, dead individuals begin messaging them, a cell phone works without a battery, a completely working vehicle will not begin, wild canines assault them, etc. What&#8217;s going on around them? Who&#8217;s the baffling individual messaging them from the incredible past? What&#8217;s more, what do they need?&nbsp;</span>

    <span>In excess of a loathsomeness spine chiller, Boomika is an eco-tale that isn&#8217;t bashful with regards to its in-your-face informing — be ideal to Mother Earth or else&#8230;. Rathindran Prasad is so focused with conveying this message that he staggers in the narrating. The film is richly shot (the cinematographer Roberto Zazzara outlines the activity neatly) and the creation configuration feels stylish. However, while there is dignity in the visuals, the account is everything except that. One justification behind this is that the composition of the characters is too oversimplified and one-note — a prudent individual, an advanced young lady, a yellow belly, an insidious man, a dubious looking help&#8230;. Normally, the exhibitions barely register. They all vibe especially utilitarian, nothing more nothing else. Indeed, you even can&#8217;t help thinking about what drew the typically solid Aishwarya Rajesh to a job that is very conventional.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The film is likewise excessively subject to its score to cause us to feel. Prithvi Chandrashekar&#8217;s stubborn score makes a decent attempt to ingrain dread in us; indeed, even before we are shown something exciting, the music starts to foretell it denying the component of shock from the scenes. It continues to toss extravagant stuff like Gaia Hypothesis and PT Extinction, and keeping in mind that these are intriguing at a theoretical level, we never discover the scenes as including on the grounds that the characters appear to be far off. Furthermore, after a point, it starts to look like a full length PSA on natural protection.</span>
