    <span>You do not have the braveness and confidence to stroll as much as the man/woman you want in this age of FB. What do you do then? Send a friendship request. That&#8217;s what Vishal and Preeti do. Simple? Not without a doubt&#8230; Additionally on this age of hidden identities&#8230;.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: The first notion: Why fraaandship and no longer friendship? Even earlier than you can in reality find a solution to that there is more: Why s-smoooching and not smooching? Why lip-is-stick and no longer lipstick? Why sup and no longer extremely good? Maybe it really is how it is intended to be.</span>

    <span>Saqib Saleen, aka Vishal turns into Vish who has the hots for Malvika (Tara D&#8217;Souza), aka Malu. But Malu it seems has the hots for Rahul (Nishant Dahiya). Begins mission FB. Vish realises the one posing as Malu on social community is actually his classmate Preeti (Saba Azad) &#8212; in short Pree &#8212; who in turn likes Rahul. Too complicated? Wait, there&#8217;s more&#8230;. Before the friendship request despatched among the 2 university goers turns into love forever, it takes a whole lot of dynamics &#8212; teasing, taunting, I-cannot stand-you-moments, I-clearly-miss-you syndromes&#8230; Until the pals sincerely admit being in love. Of course, after revealing their real identities beyond the digital world.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>And that is exactly while the friendship will become fraaandship&#8230; A</span><span>nd is going all kitsch. The rookies do invest an upbeat power in their roles in particular Saqib Saleem and Saba Azad.</span>
