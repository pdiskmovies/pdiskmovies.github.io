    <span>Noah Baumbach’s latest movie, “While We’re Young,” begins with the picture of an lovable little one with a sweetly tinkling lullaby version of David Bowie’s “Golden Years” gambling in the history. It’s a assessment that perfectly encapsulates the movie’s push-pull between the information of age and the optimism of kids, as well as the stability it strikes among zesty ambition and quiet resignation.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Baumbach’s lead characters—an established husband and spouse performed with a natural, lived-in chemistry through Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts—are so vocal approximately how content material they may be as childless New Yorkers in their mid-40s that it’s clean they’re protesting an excessive amount of. And yet, after they strike up an not going friendship with a spirited couple in their mid-20s, they can’t help however get sucked into their active vortex. As author and director, Baumbach lets in us to enjoy the silliness of the older couple’s newfound lust for existence, whether it manifests itself in a today&#8217;s fedora or a hip-hop dance elegance. But when you consider that he’s the equal age as Stiller and Watts’ characters, he’s additionally respectable to them in their awkward fumblings. He is them, and they are us.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>At the same time, he gives a biting but affectionate skewering of Brooklyn hipster tradition via the characters of Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried, both for its ridiculousness and ubiquity as well as for the manner it makes the relaxation of us feel impossibly antique. The information are delightfully dead-on. These are those who make artisanal ice cream, trip bicycles anywhere, play board games and handiest pay attention to tune on vinyl. (That golden oldie “All Night Long” by Lionel Richie is amongst their favorites.) But there’s a seize: While Driver and Seyfried and their pals are actively retro, additionally they own a generational entitlement—an expectation that they must have something they want, and feature it now, without having to work too hard to get it.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Stiller’s Josh, with the aid of contrast, has worked way too tough over the last decade on a dense and overlong documentary approximately intellectualism and power and a few such; I received’t even trouble looking to give an explanation for it to you due to the fact looking Josh try to explain it&#8217;s miles fun sufficient. His wife, Cornelia, is a clever and seasoned producer whose father (an underused Charles Grodin) is a pioneer of the genre alongside the traces of a Maysles or a Pennebaker. Josh yearns for such greatness and esteem, but it has eluded him. The individual is a perfect match for Stiller’s patented blend of restlessness and self-deprecation; more so than the only he played in Baumbach’s extra dramatic “Greenberg.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Yet Josh feels rejuvenated whilst Driver’s character, the huge-eyed and warmhearted Jamie, suggests as much as audit the college elegance he teaches and fawns throughout him. An aspiring documentarian himself, he quickly becomes Josh’s new BFF; meanwhile, Jamie’s spouse and steady associate, Seyfried’s foul-mouthed Darby, befriends Cornelia and impresses her with an easy cool. Through zippy and nicely-crafted use of montage and manufacturing layout, Baumbach superbly exhibits the contrasts in these&nbsp; couples’ lives.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>There are lines of Woody Allen at work here as “While We’re Young” vividly makes fun of a selected culture of hyper-articulate New York denizen, as well as the way its characters try to stave off the malaise of growing older by clinging to characters who radiate the extraordinary promise of kids. But it additionally takes a clear-eyed study the narcissism which could end result from settling into a conceited life of parenthood and domesticity, as evidenced by using Josh and Cornelia’s former BFFs, performed sharply by using Maria Dizzia and Adam Horovitz. (Better referred to as Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys, Horovitz is first rate on this—a total natural and a surprising supply of a calm and stability in a film complete of flux.)</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But “While We’re Young” takes a flip within the 1/3 act because it grapples with a few ethical dilemmas, and it doesn’t pretty paintings. It will become angrier and heavier as Josh uses his inquisitive nature to unearth some darkish truths—each approximately himself and his new pals. It looks like a completely distinct movie as it reaches its very public climax, and an inferior one.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Many Baumbach films function exquisite but immature human beings doing terrible things to every other (“The Squid and the Whale”, “Margot at the Wedding”) and “While We’re Young” is not any exception. The observant and mocking humor that makes the movie’s first two-thirds so breezy and exciting gives manner to shattering realizations, but Baumbach ultimately tempers that intuition fairly with the aid of displaying genuine sympathy for Stiller’s person.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>“While We’re Young” searches for the blurry line all of us cross as soon as we’ve entered center age, finds it and tramples throughout it, however it does so with kindness for those folks who’ve made that inevitable journey and survived with some dignity intact.</span>
