    <span>Bumbling cop Chatur Singh (Sanjay Dutt) is sent on a unique challenge to South Africa to solve a excessive profile case involving the homicide of a politician and a cache of diamonds. But earlier than he can redeem his botched up career he ought to deal with a gaggle of loonies which encompass a crazy mafia don (Satish Kaushik), a weird taxi driver (Sanjay Mishra), a hysterical boss (Anupam Kher) and a pretty damsel in misery (Ameesha Patel).</span>

    <span>Movie Review: Is this purported to be a desi Pink Panther? Sad. Because Sanjay Dutt&#8217;s goofy cop act borders on the juvenile, in preference to the humorous. His gruesome hair do and sartorial get-up aren&#8217;t the best jarring point of the movie. Equally bizarre is his performance which completely fails to do what it was intended to: elicit laughter.</span>

    <span>In reality, the filmmaker fails to use any of his comic actors, and he has so many of them. Consummate comedian actors like Satish Kaushik, Sanjay Mishra and Suresh Menon completely fail to cheer you with their lack lustre comedy, simply due to the fact no person has taken the pains to trouble about the nitty-gritty like tale, screenplay, individual improvement and speak.&nbsp;</span><span>The movie ends with the promise of a sequel. Fine, but will someone hassle about the niceties of movie making first.</span>
