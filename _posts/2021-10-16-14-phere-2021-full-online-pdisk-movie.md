    <span>School darlings Aditi Karwasra (Kriti Kharbanda) and Sanjay Lal Singh (Vikrant Massey) have a truly amazing life and romantic tale. While the two have an effective profession at a similar organization in Delhi, the two of them hail from universal families. Inconvenience in heaven starts when they choose to get hitched. Be that as it may, Sanjay is a Rajput from Bihar and Aditi is a Jat from Rajasthan and their families will not endure any union external their positions. To get hitched to one another, while keeping their folks glad, the couple plot an intricate arrangement with their companions and partners from work. What unfurls next is a progression of turns, misfortunes that take steps to deface their great plans of conjugal delight&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Audit: Sanjay a theater aficionado bonehead from Jahanabad in Bihar becomes hopelessly enamored with his school senior Aditi, a striking jatni from Jaipur. Similar as fantasies, they are living and adoring a glad existence with effective vocations. Be that as it may, the pressing factor from their moderate groups of getting hitched inside their station continues to float like a foreboding shadow over their heads. At the point when it seems as though the families will not surrender the tireless pursuit, Sanjay and Aditi plan an intricate dramatization roping in his kindred performers Amay (Jameel Khan) and Zubina (Gauhar Khan) just as their office partners. While it seems as though the gathering would be capable draw off the act of two weddings (henceforth the title 14 phere), life has different plans.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>A satire of mistakes, 14 Phere starts solid with a plotline suggestive of Priyadarshan film. In any case, as the film advances, the story turns out to be very unsurprising and muddled, which shows up more like a variety of comparative movies. Chief Devanshu Singh attempts to weave in numerous piercing themes like casteism, honor killing and endowment through this social parody, which raises the assumption for the watcher. Possibly he might have done equity with it, had the screenplay been firmly put. At the point when they consider it a social satire, watchers expect significant zingers, which the film neglects to convey. All things considered, a spotless family parody can be engaging for all age bunches who partake in a decent shaadi film.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>The film rides on the shoulders of the capable Vikrant Massey who makes an honest effort to keep the show running with depiction of the basic Bihari Rajput, a job that he pulls off easily. While Kriti&#8217;s screen presence is staggering, particularly in the wedding and ethnic clothing types, she neglects to coordinate to the gifted acting of Vikrant. Indeed, even as she makes a decent attempt to depict an intense and valiant Jatni, she is left with an indifferent appearance articulation for most parts. The chitchat among Jameel and Gauhar as theater entertainers, just as their individual exhibitions are a treat to watch. Their humor is all around planned by the person. Yamini Das as Sarla oozes such soft warmth as Sanjay&#8217;s mom that the watcher would need to give her an embrace for being sweet to say the least. The absolute most valuable minutes in the film are among her and Kriti as the mother and girl in-law, a second improved by the profound version &#8216;Slam Sita&#8217; sung wonderfully by Rekha Bharadwaj.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>By and large, the film would positively speak to the individuals who love family adventures and shaadi shows. Because of its oversimplified depiction of characters and clean parody, it can possibly be an end of the week family film time pick. However, better composition and some great discoursed might have achieved some significant exhibitions, given the pertinence of the topic.</span>
