The young men in his area aren&#8217;t too quick to even think about allowing him to play cricket with them. Not every person he experiences gets used to him. His dad Ranjit (Kaizaad Kotwal) is disinclined to the possibility of Ahaan doing whatever he might feel like doing.

  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>That is in no way, shape or form the main significant struggle in Ahaan&#8217;s life. One of his neighbors, Ozzy (Arif Zakaria), a neatness freak, is a heap of confusions. He is a man with extreme OCD. His masochist obsession with not letting the littlest things around the house out of its appointed spot splits apart him and his significant other Anu (Niharika Singh). The last leaves him after a battle and the man, a broker in shares, is passed on to nurture his injuries.</span>
