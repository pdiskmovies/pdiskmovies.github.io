    <span>Three continual bachelors see their lifestyles move right into a tizzy after they fall in love. It doesn&#8217;t take long earlier than they start to miss the guy bonding and realise that girls are virtually from Venus, which for them ought to be the maximum unfriendly, irrational planet in the sun device.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: The film has an interesting premise. It attempts to investigate the simple incompatibility of the yin and the yang thru a set of urban yuppies who try to construct and unbuild relationships within the harsh city. The gender bias and miscomprehensions have an thrilling twist as the three younger bachelors give up their carefree camara</span><span>derie to deal with the never-ending demands of their girlfriends.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>But so far, so right. The film has two most important troubles which make it relatively tedious viewing. First, it stretches a paper-skinny tale to inordinate lengths and turns into a real check of staying power. The plot would not appear to transport in advance from the fight-and-makeup sequences between the 3 ill-matched couples. The fights become repetitive and you grow to be wishing they just supply each other a wreck&#8230;. And you, a destroy too.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Secondly is the appalling gender skew. Okay, relationships move wrong, however is it right in charge all the misdeeds at the foul female species. Doesn&#8217;t seem truthful, without a doubt.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The movie had promise and does have some funny sequences. But by and big, it is a case of promises unfulfilled.</span>
