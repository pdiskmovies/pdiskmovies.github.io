    <span>Naren (Ajay Devgn), Abhay (Emraan Hashmi) and Milind (Omi Vaidya) want to feature some spark to their love lifestyles. They may be roomies however the three of them have diametrically hostile love testimonies. Naren&#8217;s misplaced his coronary heart to his twenty-something secretarial intern (Shazahn) no matter being a divorcee on the wrong aspect of 40.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Abhay is happy to play toy boy to rich and bored housewife, Tisca Chopra till he meets her free-spirited daughter, Shruti Haasan, at the same time as Milind Kelkar is willing to do whatever for wannabe actor, Shraddha Das, although it means spending his life&#8217;s financial savings for a clever climber. Will the three guys live luckily ever after?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: Madhur Bhandarkar attempts to alternate tracks. He tries a transfer-over from critical, difficult-hitting cinema that chooses to show the underbelly of society to a light-hearted observe the affairs of the coronary heart. Does he be triumphant? Well, partially so. For Dil To Baccha Hai Ji might also have its coronary heart inside the right region but the tone is a chunk tenuous and the comedy best intermittently breezy.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Each of the 3 love tracks have their execs and cons. The highpoint of Ajay Devgn&#8217;s romance is Ajay Devgn of direction. The actor does look visibly uncomfortable with all that talk of virginity and when-did-you-lose-it business and in fact brings out the guffaws when he breaks right into a &#8217;70s ballad at a yuppie birthday celebration. Emraan&#8217;s dil dosti story stands proud for its gleeful dirty rotten scoundrel act and for the sheer dignity that Tisca Chopra adds to the predator girl cameo. With Omi Vaidya, you realize what&#8217;s there to smile approximately: the man&#8217;s boyish innocence and his never-say-die zeal which, as in 3 Idiots, is completely misplaced once more. The girls too effortlessly slip into their respective shoes, playing heartbreakers to the hilt. While Shazahn is bubbly and sweet, Shruti is bloodless and calculating, Shraddha is outrageously exploitative and Tisca is mature and moody.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>So in which&#8217;s the glitch? First, the love tangle receives repetitive; the period is a chunk too lengthy; the humour missing in lots of locations and the Madhur make-over as a comedy maestro incredibly 1/2-hearted. Nevertheless, there is sufficient temper and attitude in the film to make for a pleasing viewing. And there&#8217;s Mohit Chauhan too. Check out his melodious ditty, Abhi kuch dino se, which forms the leitmotif of the film. Very hummable.</span>
