    <span>A story of a gushing mother (Vidya Balan) who uses age old yet remarkable approach to control her child Sonu (Sanika Patel) in the correct course.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Audit: &#8216;Natkhat&#8217; spins around the account of Sonu (Sanika Patel), a 7-year-old kid who returns home one day casually gloats to his dad and granddad about kidnapping his female cohort at school and &#8216;showing the young lady something new.&#8217; On one hand, the family patriarch smiles and says, &#8220;Ladka hain, ho jaata hain,&#8221; inferring that Sonu is just affected by TV, and that he should restrict his survey to the Ramayana and Mahabharata from now into the foreseeable future. Sonu&#8217;s mom, then again, is worried about the chance of her child acquiring profound established characteristics of male pettiness. She brings matters into her hands by showing Sonu the upsides of balance through the deep rooted craft of sleep time stories.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Thoughts like &#8220;can&#8217;t keep those rowdy boys down,&#8221; &#8220;young men don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; have been so profoundly instilled in our socio-social texture that regularly youthful personalities assimilate these accidentally. Shaan Vyas splendidly outlines something very similar in this friendly dramatization while wearing the chief&#8217;s cap interestingly. The eating table scene, in which the entirety of the men in the house are eating and ladies are serving them chapatis, is magnificently shot to represent the meaning of the male-female force elements.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The screenplay has been carefully composed by Annukampa Harsh and Shaan Vyas. With the assistance of a sleep time story—of Raja Rudra Kumar and his girl Urmi—the hero discusses a general public without ladies and the world which is pretty much kicking the bucket attributable to its own craziness. The story and foundation score are slyly consolidated to clarify the characteristics and analogies among ladies and birds, rulers and youthful rascals. At first, the account consumes most of the day to build up Sonu&#8217;s character qualities, particularly the negative impacts in his day to day existence. Be that as it may, the characters have the profundity and carry the necessary force with their demonstrations.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Wearing straightforward sarees, Vidya Balan (who has likewise co-delivered this film with Ronnie Screwvala), assumes her part of a home-creator and a caring mother with conviction. Her person hits hard on poisonous manliness, and she&#8217;s calm sharing screen space with a debutante youngster craftsman, Sanika Patel. The mother-child bond will make you feel great inside and even move you to tears in numerous scenes. Regardless of being behind a shroud, Vidya immaculately shows her distress when her child nonchalantly recommends to his dad how to handle a hazardous lady: &#8220;Toh ussey utha lo na, dad!&#8221; That&#8217;s an epic second when she understands that she should exceed all expectations to destroy male centric society in her family.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>All said, &#8216;Natkhat&#8217; adequately battles male centric culture in a short 33-minute time span. It resembles a tribute to all ladies who wind up secured comparative circumstances and attempting to breakdown the thick dividers of man centric society. This one unquestionably merits a watch.</span>
