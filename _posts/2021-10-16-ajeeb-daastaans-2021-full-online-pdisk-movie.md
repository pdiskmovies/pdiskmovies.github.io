    <span>This collection addresses the subject of basic bitterness in cold relationships, broken hearts and mystery personalities, standing obstructions and sex predispositions, and, above all, how quiet love vanquishes the whole gang.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>&#8216;Ajeeb Daastaans&#8217;, as the title proposes, is intensely put resources into the &#8216;enormous uncover&#8217; or delivering shock worth to every one of its accounts—and there are four of them—and the collection opens with the primary bit &#8216;Majnu&#8217; by Shashank Khaitan. A lot more youthful and physically freed Lipakshi (Fatima Sana Shaikh) is hitched to genuinely and actually inaccessible neighborhood thug Babloo bhaiya. She is a desolate princess—of political nature—stuck unceasingly in her superb house. Until a MBA graduate, Raj Kumar (Armaan Ralhan) appears at their doorstep and Lipakshi gets into a hot undertaking with him. Theirs is a hurricane sentiment however one that would free the two: he from all that his dad has accomplished for an unreasonable Babloo, and Lipakshi, from Babloo himself. Obviously, Shashank Khaitan needed to feature the bleak reality that comprise accommodation relationships and political contacts yet his characters and their enthusiastic associate (or its absence) doesn&#8217;t appear to be certifiable. Jaideep Ahlawat is browning penises of men for hitting on a spouse he couldn&#8217;t care less about, Fatima Sana Shaikh is wildly enamored with a man she—obviously—has no genuine on-screen science with. Khaitan&#8217;s &#8216;Majnu&#8217; is a hurried story of adoration and vengeance with no adjusted characters and minimal visual and true to life advance. It is cack-given and needs gravitas at all.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The second story by Raj Mehta—named &#8216;Khilauna&#8217;— is a significant deviation from its archetype and digs profound into financial worries that have been pervasive locally for a long time. Two stranded at this point convenient sisters are irritated with the new neighborhood secretary for detaching power which they had sourced through unlawful means. The prospective daddy has eyes on Meenal (Nushrat Bharucha) and the woman knows it. The more youthful and happy sister Binny (Inayat Verma) is that little beast in camouflage that does regular tricks with Meenal like a star. Meenal needs a way in to the secretary&#8217;s home with the goal that she can ultimately persuade him to reevaluate her rehashed supplications for power. Her beau Sushil (Abhishek Banerjee) from the clothing shop is incredulous about the arrangement. &#8220;Kya howdy kar lega? Uske gharme biwi hain. Dekhta hai toh dekhne de,&#8221; Meenal guarantees him. Raj Mehta has a fascinating interpretation of India&#8217;s group qualification and the abuse and implicit pressure that is widespread among haves and those who lack wealth. In contrast to the main story, this one takes as much time as necessary to build up the uniqueness of each character. On the off chance that Meenal is guileful and a brazen pioneer, Binny is her capable second-in-order. Sushil, on the othr handis an affection struck little dog and addresses that class of men who submit to their oppressors. The peak, which is again filled in as a &#8216;surprising disclosure&#8217;, is one that is thoroughly examined and gives the crowd something to consider upon.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Neeraj Ghaywan&#8217;s &#8216;Geeli Pucchi&#8217; is a finished knockout in this compilation. Ghaywan, through talented composition and surprisingly shrewd course, delivers the situation of a lady living in an uncalled for world: first, for being a lady in a male-overwhelmed plant, then, at that point for being Dalit and afterward for deciding to unflinching. Ghaywan probably realized he is making something phenomenally significant, which is an incredible entertainer like Konkona Sen Sharma is depended with the battered-however not-broken Bharti Mandal. Ghyan weds the dejection of Bharti with an apparently happy and energetic Priya Sharma (Aditi Rao Hydari) whose advantaged life and childhood is an unmistakable difference to the existence of difficulties Bharti perseveres. Misses out on the advancement to Priya for not &#8216;knowing dominate&#8217;, her pet isn&#8217;t permitted to crap on &#8216;their&#8217; side of the state and she isn&#8217;t seen or recognized as a lady. It doesn&#8217;t help either that Bharti is longing for her previous darling.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>What truly hangs out in this story is that there are no saviors or guardian angels in Bharti&#8217;s story: a similar Dalit lady who is dealt with brutally for A) being a lady, and B) for being a Dalit. Ghaywan&#8217;s Meela is a solid, fiery woman with shades of dark to her persona. She doesn&#8217;t desire after the person who makes her extremely upset, all things considered, utilizes misdirection and control to grab what ought to have been hers in any case. This sort of striking portrayal of a lady from a minimized local area might have turned out badly yet the narrating is so naturally grasping that towards the end you nearly need Bharti to obliterate Priya. Not for being scheming, no. Be that as it may, for reprimanding her for being, all things considered, her.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>There are not very many entertainers who can act out their inward disturbance with simply their face muscles the manner in which Konkona can. &#8216;Geeli Pucchi&#8217; is the same. Aditi Rao Hydari has her own fights as the special child who doesn&#8217;t have the foggiest idea how to adore: both in a real sense and allegorically. The entertainer, with her beguiling disposition and honest honesty, depicts an alternate sort of picture for battle: man controlled society, absence of comprehension of her sexual personality and so forth. This story moves starting with one glaring cultural issue then onto the next with sheer perfection and before you know it, you have seen everything in a question of near 30 minutes.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The last venture is by debutant chief Kayoze Irani who transports you into the universe of affection anthems and unusual workmanship and specialists meanwhile keeping you in contact with the brutal real factors of life and love. Natasha (Shefali Shah) is in a broken marriage and has a hard of hearing little girl. The spouse (Tota Roy Chowdhury) is endeavoring to accommodate his uniquely abled girl and possibly think of an innovation based arrangement. Be that as it may, two or three quarrels and squabbles about missed meals and WhatsApp talks, among other repairable issues in their marriage. She tells Kabir (Manav Kaul), a hard of hearing painter, she had &#8216;one committed relationship and it&#8217;s finished&#8217;.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>&#8216;Ankahi&#8217;— the title of this track—occurs over a time of a couple of days and reasonableness be condemned for shouldn&#8217;t something be said about&#8217;s to unfurl! The brilliant music at the foundation and that unmissable voice of Prateek Kuhad returns you to 90s Bollywood when love was less complex, and its show, outwardly dazzling.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It isn&#8217;t not difficult to wed the ordinariness of existence with an Utopian world yet Irani does it easily. &#8216;Ankahi&#8217; believes that its watchers are astute to figure out the real story thus Irani—fearlessly—passes on a great deal on us to decipher. Presently we don&#8217;t think about you, yet we shut our PCs with a major, wide grin on our countenances.</span>
