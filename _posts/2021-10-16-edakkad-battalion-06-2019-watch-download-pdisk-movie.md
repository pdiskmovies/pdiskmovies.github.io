  <span>Shafeek Mohammed, an military officer, is domestic for holidays and reveals himself supporting and protective his humans in their website want.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Review: Based on a true story, Edakkad Battalion 06 is written via P Balachandran and directed by means of Swapnesh K Nair. The film, with an obvious military reference in the name itself, is not your run-of-the-mill army story.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Capt. Shafeek Mohammed (Tovino Thomas) comes lower back to his fatherland, Edakkad in Kozhikode, for a holiday. With a newfound self assurance from the newly earned appreciate from his activity, Shafeek unearths himself assisting anyone in his village.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The military is from time to time an overused story trope to pitch nationalism. And if now not treated with care it can fall flat, like Edakkad Battalion 06. One can&#8217;t assist however experience disenchanted when the onscreen chemistry of the artists makes you want to feel, but the script does not supply. Much like in &#8216;Theevandi&#8217;, Tovino and Samyuktha have a great onscreen chemistry that makes you desire had it been the valuable subject of the narrative it can have atleast glued your eyes to the display. Sinu Sidharathu who cranks the digicam for Edakkad Battalion 06 and makes it a visually appealing revel in even if the story drags on. Samyuktha Menon proves that she can emote thru her eyes, plenty of what she does during the movie.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Music with the aid of Kailas Menon is mediocre at satisfactory, &#8216;Nee Himamazhayay&#8217; being the best noteworthy tune. Tovino Thomas finds little or no of scope for a performance. His portrayal of Capt. Shafeek Mohammed is a instead cliched cool animated film of a heroic soldier. The film pressure feeds the audience with the tallness of valour and bravado of a soldier. While it is going without announcing that a soldier&#8217;s contribution to the state is not trivial, however in Edakkad Battalion 06 the narrative over plays it making it feels strained. Also, one unearths many storylines forgotten or misplaced because the tale proceeds.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Edakkad Battalion 06 comes as a extensively stretched out tribute to the courageous&nbsp;</span><span>martyrs of the land. The gravity and effect of martyrdom performs out inside the ultimate 10 mins of the film, which by using by way of some distance the handiest part that manages to incite an emotion. Whether one would need to brave an hour an a half of a movie for the last fifteen mins of an emotional message is a very personal desire.</span>
