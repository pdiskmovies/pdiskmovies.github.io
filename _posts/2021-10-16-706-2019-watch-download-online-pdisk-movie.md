    <span><span>At the point when a prominent specialist disappears for 11 days, a 10-year-old patient of his significant other (who is likewise a specialist) approaches and makes some surprising disclosures. As the story unfurls, it is uncovered that every one of the characters in the film have insider facts of their own that return to one specific lodging in rural Mumbai.&nbsp;</span></span>

  <div>
    <span><span>Survey: Dr Anil Asthana (Mohan Agashe) vanishes under baffling conditions and inside 11 days of his much pitched vanishing, Dr Asthana&#8217;s specialist spouse Dr Suman Asthana (Divya Dutta) is constrained into meeting a youngster (Yashvit Sancheti) with an obscure ailment, who ends up knowing significantly more than he is driving on.&nbsp;</span></span>

    <span><span>Had it not been for the e-tagging entryways, the crowd would have attempted to effectively recognize the class of this film â€“ indeed, it is that heedless. From dark enchantment and rebirth to paranormal components and endless love, the head of the film, Shravan Kumar, appears to have attempted everything except nothing truly works.&nbsp;</span></span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span><span>The cinematography smells of ineptness and the speed of the scenes and arrangements at a speed more slow than the slowest thing possible.&nbsp;</span></span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span><span>Veteran entertainers like Atul Kulkarni and Divya Dutta attempt, yet even they look apparently lost and impartial after a point. The story has been extended past excruciating lengths and is an entirety of everything odd. What&#8217;s more, makes no sense and how. For instance, simply a day after it is uncovered that the specialist is dead, the wide range of various characters approach concealing their own transgressions and no one truly puts forth an attempt to discover why the specialist meets with his awkward destruction.&nbsp;</span></span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span><span>The youngster entertainer is certainly not prepared to assume the job of an impetus in the movie and the equivalent goes for the chief and screenwriter too. The solitary secret that should be opened is the reason was &#8216;706&#8217; made in any case.</span></span>
