    <span>The film is a collage of the studies of a group of migrants who come to Mumbai, chasing their goals. Brothers Ram and Shyam come to Mumbai to end up big dons. Meghna wants to emerge as a famous Bollywood actress whilst Rhea is decided to installation a salon that gives each person a make-over. Will the dream town help the dreamers fulfil their goals?</span>

    <span>Movie Review: Here&#8217;s one greater attempt to lay bare the soul of Mumbai and apprehend what makes it tick. But the film maker appears to have misplaced the plot absolutely because the film is a moved quickly patchwork of sequences featuring random characters in search of random things. The hunt for stardom, gangster reputation, financial independence all become involved in one large kidnap plan which makes no headway by any means. Everybody seems to be going for walks round in circles and Mumbai&#8217;s magical attraction turns into nearly farcical. Equally unfunny is the spoof on Amitabh Bachchan, his films and his Kaun Banega Crorepati display.</span>

    <span>Understandably, Mumbai and its a good deal pointed out spirit does provide rich fodder for the creativeness and there had been umpteen memorable memories which have sprung from its melting pot. But there has been a load of junk too spilling forth. Here, nothing is mast: Neither Mumbai nor the Kallanders who come on the lookout for achievement. Bad performances, a botched up script and a tone it really is neither comedian nor critical: Avoid.</span>
