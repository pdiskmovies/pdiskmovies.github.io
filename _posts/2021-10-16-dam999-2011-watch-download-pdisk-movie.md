    <span>The movie offers with the catastrophe that big dams motive to human settlement and is primarily based at the catastrophe that struck China while the Banqiao dam burst in 1975 and claimed the lives of almost 2,50,000 victims. It unfolds as a human drama wherein a marine engineer returns to his local village along with his younger son, seeking out a treatment for his diabetes. A unmarried parent, he meets up along with his adolescence beloved and sparks begin to fly again notwithstanding the fact that their dating is doomed, consistent with the celebrities. Meanwhile, evil flesh presser, Aashish Vidyarthi threatens chaos in his constituency by going in advance with the debatable dam assignment. Will wish continue to exist?</span>

    <span>Movie Review: Even earlier than the film opens, controversy surrounds it with the ban in Tamil Nadu. The kingdom has banned the film at the presumption that it&#8217;d cause hassle with Kerala, the neighbouring nation given that they experience the story is primarily based at the Mullaperiyar dam for which Tamil Nadu holds lease rights for 999 years.</span>

    <span>But critically, the movie is much less approximately the dam and greater about things you fail to recognize. Like, a Raj remanent who shoots himself in his head, a marine engineer who commands a deliver that catches fireplace instantly, a romance that is half-brewed and bogged down by means of regressive overtones approximately unfavourable stars, an ayurvedic medical doctor who thinks he&#8217;s an infallible seer, a baby-kisser who serenades a puppy cobra and torments his bodily challenged spouse with it, at the same time as duping the village people, like maximum filmy politicians do.</span>
