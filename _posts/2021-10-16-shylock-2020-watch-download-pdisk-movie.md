    <span>Producer Prathapa Varma locks horns with Boss, a money lender, after he fails to pay again what he owes the latter. Why is Boss so interested by the conflict with Prathapa Varma?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Shylock Review: &#8216;Be it old era or new generation, Boss is continually the hero&#8217;, says Boss (Mammootty) when Commissioner of Police Felix John (Siddique) asks if he&#8217;s interested in a twist like in new era movies, in which the villain turns hero all of a surprising. Like Ajai Vasudev&#8217;s previous films, Rajadhi Raja and Masterpiece, Shylock is all about the &#8216;hero&#8217; played via Mammootty.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It is a natural Mammootty fan movie and he goes to be the &#8216;Mass ka Baap&#8217; usually. If everybody wants to boost an eyebrow about some thing inside the film, especially the punch dialogues thrown by Boss every so often, he replies that &#8216;the &#8216;cinematic bullshit&#8217; … &#8216;will retain till the give up&#8217; and hold it does.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Producer Prathapa Varma (Kalabhavan Shajohn) is on the vicinity of his modern-day film and as he&#8217;s in discussions with the director approximately the extended agenda of the movie, he receives a name from Boss. He ignores it and then enters Ganapathy (Hareesh Kanaran) with a warning to no longer steer clear of Boss&#8217; call. Prathapa Varma maintains to accomplish that and whilst the set is ready to take the hero&#8217;s access shot of the film, there comes the real &#8216;hero&#8217; of the movie making his manner hitting anybody coming his way.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Boss is a money lender and Prathapa Varma has cheated him through not returning the money he owes. Despite the warnings by means of Boss and his assistants, Prathapa Varma with the help of his commissioner pal maintains to mess with Boss. And the battle starts. The question is, why is Boss so inquisitive about the conflict with Prathapa Varma? Is there a story inside the story?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Like one of the dialogues in the movie, the movie starts offevolved as a comedy, then turns into a thriller and ends as a revenge tale and at some point of we may want to see Mammootty&#8217;s one guy display. &#8216;The mega superstar&#8217;s mega overall performance&#8217; is accentuated by thumping tune from Gopi Sunder, Renadive&#8217;s cinematography and punch dialogues by Aneesh Ahamed and Bibin Mohan. The best aspect of the movie is the story of Boss&#8217; ‘annan’ (Raj Kiran) and Lakshmi (Meena) which takes place in Kambam Theni, equivalent to the Tamil movie memories that we had been watching.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Throughout the movie, Mammootty keeps mouthing Tamil movie dialogues from Rajinikanth movies and every now and then of Vijay films which triggers nostalgia a number of the mass movie lovers. But the question is, why are we continually preserving on to the old classics? Are we so missing in creativity that we&#8217;ve nothing to do with a &#8216;mega star&#8217; apart from placing old wine inside the new bottle and garnering claps. The film is a natural mass entertainer, with the method of a masala movie, inclusive of a special dance number.</span>
