      <span>Bhanupriya (Urvashi Rautela) is a savvy, exceptionally qualified school young lady whose greatest lament is that she is as yet a virgin. With a little push from her ground breaking companion Rukul (Rumana Molla), Bhanu — as she is affectionately called — marshals the boldness to start a cozy experience. What&#8217;s more, that snowballs into a satire of blunders.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>Audit: Bhanupriya has various honors amazingly and has consistently been a star understudy. Despite the fact that her folks are isolated and are continually in constant conflict, Bhanu actually has a day to day life loaded up with affection. Yet, she hates the way that every one of her friends have started satisfying their sexual dreams aside from her. She is in school but to kiss a kid!&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>With her companion Rukul scoring men at an alarmingly high rate, the deliberate tension on Bhanu to &#8220;part with her bloom&#8221; is mounting. After various bombed endeavors at losing her virginity and a tarot card peruser&#8217;s expectation that she would consistently stay a virgin, Bhanu at last tracks down a &#8216;gallant man&#8217; — Shartiya otherwise known as Abhimanyu (Gautam Gulati). As his moniker states, he would go to any length to win a bet. Is Shartiya going to prevail upon her and break the curse? The truth will surface eventually!&nbsp;</span>

    <div>
      <span>Composed and coordinated by Ajay Lohan, the saying of this dramedy is intimately acquainted — a geeky young lady searching for approaches to investigate her sexuality. In comes a terrible, way-out-of-class kid and bam! She goes completely gaga over him. Having said that, &#8216;Virgin Bhanupriya&#8217; exposes the no-no around one&#8217;s sexual longings in our general public and how guardians stay away from &#8216;the discussion&#8217; with their kids, in addition to other things. In any case, the diegesis just figures out how to address subtexts that merit inside and out dealing with — the idea of an adoration kid, teenager pregnancy and single parenthood. Likewise, a portion of the equal characters add little to the all around dreary content. A valid example: Natasha Suri as Shonali.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>Urvashi Rautela experts the young lady nearby symbol. Archana Puran Singh as her bombastic, liberal mother is a joy to watch. A portion of different characters that leave an imprint are Sumit Gulati as stammer &#8216;prem pujari&#8217; Rajiv and Bhanu&#8217;s closest companion cum-companion Rukul. While Sumit Gulati renders the truly necessary lighthearted element at intermittent spans, Rumana Molla&#8217;s Rukul is bold and has the absolute best speeches and jokes. Our top choice: Men are sh*t and sh*t is men. Gautam Gulati, as the raucous school heart breaker, is a maverick. Regardless, he resembles a frantic endeavor to recover Aamir Khan&#8217;s machismo from &#8216;Gulaam&#8217;. Likewise, the science between the lead pair doesn&#8217;t advance even by parody norms — the affection doesn&#8217;t bloom on screen and the physical allure feels constrained upon its masters.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span>&#8216;Virgin Bhanupriya&#8217; has an honorable plan and its heart is in the perfect spot, however a conflicting storyline, combined with normal sayings, make this virginity talk something I wouldn&#8217;t be too enthused about paying attention to this end of the week.</span>
