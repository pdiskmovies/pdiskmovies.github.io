    P<span>uneet and Munmun, a model family unit, track down their arranged life being shaken separated when they have a guest, Chachaji, who won&#8217;t take off from their home, regardless of an all-inclusive visit. Will they miss him when he goes?&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: Neat. Unobtrusive. Also, delicately entertaining. Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge is very not normal for the insane chuckle acts that have been making a decent attempt to make you snicker in late Bollywood. Even more a laugh and-a-grin show, this one doesn&#8217;t attempt to persuade you that life is all ha-ha-he-he. All things considered, it causes circumstances and characters that fill you with warmth and make you grin with the natural particularity of conspicuous circumstances.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>This present time whenever was the last opportunity you hauled your hair out when your &#8216;undesirable&#8217; family members from Gorakhpur, or some other humble community, arrived in your diminutive level with their annoyances and angering propensities. Like swishing before the break of sunrise, making man-made floods in your minuscule washroom or changing over your #1 window into a make-shift clothesline&#8230;Well, that is the thing that our avuncular Chachaji (Paresh Rawal) does when he shows up unannounced at companion Putani&#8217;s child, Pappu&#8217;s (Ajay Devgn) house. Pappu&#8217;s uptown spouse (Konkana Sen Sharma) is before long compelled to broil pakoras and play entertainer to his local companions who are normally attracted compellingly to this well disposed elderly person who has a grandmother&#8217;s solution for every one of their fixes and a bhajan for every one of their hardships. It doesn&#8217;t take long for outrage to be supplanted by authentic warmth, as Chachaji conveys with him an entire culture into the germicide level which had up until recently housed a family that was essentially running in a futile way of life.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Paresh Rawal drives the delicate humor unit that discovers extraordinary troopers in any semblance of Devgn (controlled and likable), Konkana (natural and grounded), Satish Kaushik (watchable) and Sanjay Mishra (noteworthy). Is it genuinely back to the 1980s for Bollywood comedies? Sit tight and look out for some a greater amount of the Basu Chatterjee-Hrishikesh Mukherjee brand recovery.</span>
