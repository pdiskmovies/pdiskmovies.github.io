  <span>Anthony Gonsalves (Madhavan), a praised cellist, and his life partner Sakshi (Anushka Shetty), a discourse and-hearing tested craftsman, go to a house that is accepted to be spooky — one where a youthful couple were bafflingly killed in 1972 (the film opens with an introduction including their homicides) — so she can get an uncommon composition. Be that as it may, Anthony winds up being killed — in a similar way as the person in 1972 — while a harmed Sakshi, who has figured out how to escape the spot, is hospitalized.&nbsp;</span>

  <span>Enters Seattle PD investigator Maha (Anjali) and her prevalent Richard (Michael Madsen). As they explore, they hit a stopping point as Anthony appears to have no adversaries. And afterward, Maha staggers on a photograph of the couple with Sonali (Shalini Pandey), Maha&#8217;s cherished companion, who has been missing even before Anthony&#8217;s homicide. What&#8217;s the association between her vanishing and this wrongdoing?&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Silence is intended to be a whodunit, however the second you get the plot focuses, the film quits being one. The explanation is that Hemant Madhukar&#8217;s filmmaking depends on composing that is loaded up with compositions instead of heart-halting disclosures (Kona Venkat is the author). Its exciting bends in the road are not just unsurprising (one key disclosure goes as far as possible up to Sigappu Rojakkal), however they unfurl in a mundane way, barely offering us the rushes we anticipate from this class. the film doesn&#8217;t attempt to support the ghastliness point from the start to keep quiet. Practically every one of the significant advancements are described through voiceovers, with the supervisor Prawin Pudi frantically attempting to savage the film by giving it a feeling of energy with a needless excess of split-screens.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The acting is deadened in general. At this point, it is a given that unfamiliar entertainers in an Indian film equivalents to off-kilter exhibitions, and even Michael Madsen (indeed, he of Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill distinction) gives the impression he took on the gig for some pocket change. All things considered, even the Indian entertainers here appear to be somewhat dull and uninterested. Anushka offers presence, yet her characterisation is feeble that we barely interface with the person. Indeed, even the shock of seeing Madhavan being projected against type wears off sooner or later, and possibly it very well may be the messy facial hair, yet the entertainer looks tired. Shalini Pandey and Subbaraju are practical while Anjali attempts to make the best of a pitifully composed job.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Add to these issues the way that amount of the film appears to have been shot in Telugu, in spite of the producers publicizing it as a Telugu-Tamil bilingual (the Telugu form is named Nishabdham), the Tamil adaptation looks like a named film, and a dismal one at that.</span>
