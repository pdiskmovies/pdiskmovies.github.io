    <span>Manu (R Madhavan) is a unhappy and critical NRI health practitioner in London who comes searching out a bride in India. He flips for a sozzled small town woman, Tanu (Kangna Ranaut) who lives along with her prolonged own family in Kanpur. But there&#8217;s a hitch. Tanu loves a goonda from Lucknow and threatens Manu with dire effects if he does not say No to the wedding. Poor Manu! He no longer best says No but attempts his first-class to get his dream girl marry her boyfriend.</span>

    <span>Movie Review: Been there, finished that? Yes, the first aspect that strikes you about Tanu Weds Manu is a hanging sense of familiarity. It wasn&#8217;t lengthy earlier than you saw Shahid Kapoor playing a comparable sacrificial lover to Kareena Kapoor in Jab We Met. And like poor Kareena, who attempts too type out her harassed emotions against the backdrop of the massive fats Punjabi wedding, Tanu too have to determine who&#8217;s higher husband material, first amidst the hustle bustle of her high-quality buddy&#8217;s boisterous going-balle-balle baraat and then at her chaotic Kanpuria network haveli.</span>

    <span>But the deja vu does not last lengthy. For no matter the predictable &#8212; and paper skinny &#8212; storyline, the movie manages to hook you with its sheer atmospherics. The director creates an exceptionally busy and colourful canvas brimming with characters who are whatever but cardboard reduce-outs. If Madhavan fleshes out a coronary heart-tugging, oh-so-lonely and acutely desi NRI, triumphing you over with his shy smiles and nicely-mannered chutzpah, then Kangna Ranaut&#8217;s wild cat rebellion is endearing too. The Friends Inc additionally pitches in an inspired act with the groom&#8217;s fine friends Deepak Dobriyal and Eijaz Khan adding fun and video games to the raucous complaints. On the bride&#8217;s aspect, it is the spunky Payal (Swara Bhaskar) who infuses verve, even at the same time as emerging as Kangna&#8217;s suggest and manual. As for Jimmy Sheirgill, have to we reiterate: Give him a role, guys; he is good! In fact, the highpoint of Tanu weds Manu is not so much the burdened romance among Madhavan and Kangana. Instead, it&#8217;s miles the `bromance&#8217; (dosti-dushmani) among Madhavan and Jimmy that grabs eyeballs with its volcanic undercurrents, which unfortunately, are too few and some distance between.</span>

    <span>And then come the sundry cityscapes&#8230;. Tanu Weds Manu lives more via its psychedelic backdrop than its drama. The movie maker along along with his cinematographer (Chirantan Das) and song director (Krsna) captures mofussil India with all its bustling splendor. Kanpur, with its overriding chaos and its criss-move alleys almost starts offevolved to breathe on screen, at the same time as the first rate Indian circle of relatives emerges as one helluva character in a single extra desi paean to the joint parivaar.</span>

  <div>
    <span>Fun while it lasts, Tanu Weds Manu throws up Bollywood&#8217;s most up-to-date obsession &#8212; small city ladies and their gunas (values) &#8212; once again. A meatier storyline and a much less messed up climax might have labored wonders for the film.</span>
