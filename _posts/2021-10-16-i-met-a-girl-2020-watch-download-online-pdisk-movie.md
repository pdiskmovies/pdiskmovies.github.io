<div>
  <span>It&#8217;s a thin line filmmakers should walk when depicting mental illness in a movie. The line is thinner when the class you&#8217;re working in is a romance, one that flirts with being a romantic parody. The risk is, that you&#8217;ll get over into &#8220;adorable,&#8221; and there&#8217;s nothing charming about being mentally ill, or coping with somebody who is in your life.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The Aussie romance &#8220;I Met a Girl&#8221; doesn&#8217;t stumble into much difficulty, in that regard. We meet our schizophrenic legend — Devon — similarly as he&#8217;s decided to do without his pills and quaff a couple. I mean, it&#8217;s his sibling Nick&#8217;s wedding day and Devon&#8217;s written a tune that he and his band, And They Said it Wouldn&#8217;t Last, are performing.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>He wants to &#8220;be there,&#8221; right? The tune is charming, and kid band handsome Devon (Brenton Thwaites of the last &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; movie) pulls it off with ebullience and talent.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>In any case, as they do, things go manically, violently off-base and Devon winds up in a hospital.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>&#8220;I was twelve when I first hear the voices,&#8221; he narrates. We have our diagnosis, and the extent of Devon&#8217;s concern. Being beautiful and talented doesn&#8217;t inoculate you against schizophrenia.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Five years later, and he&#8217;s living with Nick (Joel Jackson) and his expectant, tolerant wife Olivia (Zahra Newman). In any case, Devon is still dodging his pills, when he can. Manic episodes mean he can&#8217;t keep a task. Working at a pet store, he reacts to a conceived menace/animal abusing kid by flipping out and freeing all the budgies.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>He carries his guitar all over, yet he can&#8217;t get the band back together.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>&#8220;Time to grow up, mate,&#8221; they advise him.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>And the two voices in his head go after him when he&#8217;s unmedicated and having a bad day. Mr. Rocket is a hero &#8220;defender&#8221; who drives him into risks. Miss Needle is a Nurse Ratched menace, terrorizing him with injections, tormenting him over his failings.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>They drive him up on a rooftop and off it.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Just he doesn&#8217;t die. He wakes up in a beautiful woman&#8217;s clawfoot tub. She &#8220;dragged&#8221; him there, she says. Her name is Lucy (Lily Sullivan of TV&#8217;s &#8220;Picnic at Hanging Rock&#8221;). She&#8217;s flirtatious, kind, open and direct.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>&#8220;Like, would you say you were trying to kill yourself?&#8221;&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>She has one of those glorious &#8220;just in the movies&#8221; flats that no one whose work is dressing up like Marilyn Monroe as a waitress for a &#8217;50s themed diner. She drops everything she&#8217;s doing to go through the day with Devon, and they fall in adoration in a flash.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>We think it well before he says it. &#8220;It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve dreamt you.&#8221;&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Is she all in his head, a fantasy that his mind has created to fill one of the many voids in his life? We&#8217;ll realize when joins Nick and Devon for dinner. Just she doesn&#8217;t appear.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Her flat is unfilled. And real-estate agent Nick, with a baby coming, has no patience for Devon&#8217;s mad fantasy.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>&#8220;She&#8217;s as real as you and I&#8221; isn&#8217;t convincing.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>In any case, Devon has a piece of information, and on or off his drugs, he&#8217;s going to seek after it. He&#8217;ll leave Perth and cross Australia to Sydney and find his Lucy. And on or off his drugs, he&#8217;ll have adventures all along the way.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Filmmakers Luke Eve and Glen Dolman, Aussie TV veterans, concoct a couple of adorable episodes for Devon&#8217;s journey, and a couple of harrowing minutes as his evil spirits literally chase him crosscountry, with frantic Nick trying to figure out where his crazy kid sibling&#8217;s no more.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Visualizing Devon&#8217;s illness — with actors playing his two &#8220;voices&#8221; — is much less scary than aurally simulating what&#8217;s going on in his head. In any case, taking care to never allow us to fail to remember the seriousness of his condition shortchanges the &#8220;charming&#8221; experiences he has on his &#8220;road parody&#8221; venture.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Meeting somebody very much like himself is an or more, however different meetings are hit and miss.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Thwaites, who apparently does his own singing, has to carry the picture with his charm, and he almost does. He&#8217;s charismatic and charming and doe-looked at in his scenes with Sullivan, who appears to be more seasoned (she isn&#8217;t), world weary and wiser.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The players give &#8220;I Met a Girl&#8221; a warm and fluffy romantic lilt. Yet, all that one can say for the script is that it gives the charming stars a nice little while, and that it generally doesn&#8217;t fall for the &#8220;Love can fix what ails you&#8221; mental health romantic comedy trap.&nbsp;</span>
