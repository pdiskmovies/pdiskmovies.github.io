    <span>A soldier’s vacation turns into a complete-time undertaking to store Mumbai from terror assaults, whilst most effective taking day trip for his bride-hunt.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Review: Gagged men tumble out of his closet. Tied up terrorists and ‘sleeper cells’ too. Hell’s bells, they’re a ways from ‘slumbering beauties’. But then they must make our brave-heart Virat Bakshi (Akshay) look accurate. And he positive does. In his camouflage suits and his neon bermudas. Whether he’s on a secret project (as Defence Intelligence Agent), or romancing his boisterous ‘boxer’ belle Saiba (Sonakshi). All the at the same time as education his cop pal on the way to ‘crack a case’, or saluting his boss sergeant (Govinda, in a cutesy cameo).</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Virat’s on vacation in Mumbai – ‘ladki dekhne’ &#8211; wherein an apprehension blast kills faculty youngsters in a bus. A suspect is caught and it results in collection of greater suspects who’re part of a devious demolition plan by way of &#8211; Sleeper Cells (trained terrorists guised as commonplace men in society). His holiday becomes havoc and Virat becomes a one-man navy – who has to raze the phobia outfit and salvage Mumbai from exploding into flames. Nothing can break this lion-hearted soldier who upholds his valour, wardi and values – like a real jawan.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Murgadoss’ film (remake of the Tamil ‘Thupakki’) offers an intelligent plot, with blows, blasts and raw bone-cracking movement (Greg Powell- of &#8216;Skyfall&#8217; repute). It triggers a worry that everyone out of your paanwala to pizza-shipping boy could be a ‘closet’ terrorist (Beware!).</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>While the middle plot is compelling and finely directed, the side-tracks &#8211; like bombs wanting to be deactivated and the romantic angle, waste display-time and the songs infiltrate the plot too frequently. The movie is too long and wishes a taut edit. It has flaws too, however doesn’t fail to entertain.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Akshay’s stunts are jaw-dropping; he’s in top form and impressively leads the show without a lot assist from his squadron of actors. Farhad (the lead villain) doesn’t depart tons impact; and Sonakshi slides in for the tune and dance.&nbsp;</span><span>This one applauds the jawans who live inside the jaws of loss of life, and is a ‘awaken’ call for all the ‘sleepers’ that abound. Bravo!</span>
