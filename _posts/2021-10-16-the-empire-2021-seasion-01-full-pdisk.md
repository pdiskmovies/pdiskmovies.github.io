<span>Hotstar’s ambitious new eight-part series The Empire (created by Nikkhil Advani and directed by Mitakshara Kumar) starts in mediasres, with the Mughal king Babur (Kunal Kapoor) in the thick of his most famous war, the First Battle of Panipat (1526). Kapoor’s voice-over tells us that Babur has been “cheating death since he was a 14-year-old boy”; cue the grown-up Babur scything his way through enemy hordes. This turns out to be the first artful misdirection in a story featuring quite a few, for The Empire’s (based on the Empire of the Moghul series by Alex Rutherford) first couple of episodes don’t feature a whole lot of Kapoor.</span>
