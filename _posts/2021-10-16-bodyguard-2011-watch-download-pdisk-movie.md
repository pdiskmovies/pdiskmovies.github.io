    <span>Lovely Singh (Salman Khan), the ace bodyguard has a brand new mission. He must shield MBA pupil Divya (Kareena Kapoor) from her prospective assailants (Mahesh Manjrekar and co.). Now Divya madam occurs to be the daughter of his benefactor (Raj Babbar) and inadvertently falls in love with her brawny bodyguard. But can the rich-negative, mistress-servant divide be bridged?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: A Salman Khan movie nearly continually defies all logic, simply as it follows its personal norms on the box workplace, no matter the high-quality of the product. All that the movie wishes to have the crowds milling, cheering and developing nearly hysterical is the trademark Salman contact. This basically means a excessive-on-testosterone Salman, a pelvic-pushing Salman, a satan-can also-care Salman, a can-do-anything Salman, a human tornado Salman, a goofy-in-love Salman, and yes, principally, a shirtless Salman. Stir up this cocktail and rest confident, the box workplace will jingle, story be damned.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Once again, Bodyguard opened to an uproarious crowd, however all of the din couldn&#8217;t drown the reality that this one&#8217;s usually a non-happening film with a primary 1/2 that receives extremely repetitive and uninteresting. The romance among Kareena and Salman transpires in a juvenile manner thru infinite smartphone conversations, as Kareena attempts to masquerade because the mysterious lady from nowhere. And whilst the romantic track has nearly bored you to death, you have got an similarly lame comedy music to frustrate you. The entire sub-plot about Tsunami Singh, the servant and his antics is dull and distracting.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The movie sparks up handiest in the movement sequences which showcase Salman because the vital movement hero who can carry out the most impossible stunts &#8212; keep away from bullets, bounce across walls, crunch bones, sky dive &#8212; with impeccable ease and finesse. The fights had been excellently choreographed, especially throughout the climax. The song by way of Pritam and Himmesh Reshammiya has the usual chartbusters which include Katrina Kaif&#8217;s break up 2d appearance in the plenty touted item variety. Performance-sensible, the movie doesn&#8217;t have much to boast approximately. While Salman is his normal self, minus the Dabangg chutzpah, Kareena has seen higher days. After all serenading a cell telephone for most of the duration of the film is not a totally challenging function, is it?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The movie, a remake of a South Indian hit, can also become as every other blockbuster, like maximum Salman films have been doing inside the current beyond. Yet, unfortunately, this one&#8217;s mostly bluster.</span>
