    <span>Avanthika (Bhavika Desai) and Raj (Ravi Varma) fall in love with every other and determine to get married. They meet in a motel room and Avanthika quickly finds out approximately Raj’s actual intentions. She by chance kills him and what takes place subsequent is what 302 is all about.</span>

    <span>Review: Thrillers experience under-cooked when directors miss even a tiny element with regards to fleshing out characters and the film doesn’t even have a scope to please unless all plot holes are sealed. Unfortunately, 302 doesn’t have even the simple elements required of an amazing mystery. More than tale and script, director Karthikeya Miryala specializes in objectifying the woman lead. Even greater worrying is the crass and homophobic dialogues which might be a test to patience and are occurred as ‘comedy’.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The movie kick-starts offevolved with a set of prisoners telling their testimonies, none of them are associated with the primary plot in case you’re wondering, but seem to be wrestled into the movie just to fill the run-time. None of the testimonies make sense and turn out to be best nerve-racking the viewer. The film best receives into the thick of factors as soon as Avantika goes to the motel room. Unfortunately, all that’s required of her is to weep on every occasion she faces the camera. It’s something that makes you weep too, now not from the emotion of it all, but with remorse that this movie just gained’t end.</span>

  <div>
    <span>302 additionally has manner too many characters, performed by using Tagubothu Ramesh, Vennela Kishore, Naveen Neni and greater who stroll inside and out of the story for no reason. The humour, like we formerly referred to, is below the belt. What’s even greater bizarre is how Avanthika, who’s looking to cover up her crime takes the help of the hotel staff to accomplish that and later even calls the police officers herself to inform them about the dead frame. The ‘plot twists’ that come later on within the movie are weird and when the movie in the end ends, you sense not anything however comfort.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Seeing as how the script leaves no scope for performance, there’s not anything to talk approximately there. The music is disappointing, to say the least. 302, that is marketed as a thriller, is a subpar fare that makes no feel.</span>
