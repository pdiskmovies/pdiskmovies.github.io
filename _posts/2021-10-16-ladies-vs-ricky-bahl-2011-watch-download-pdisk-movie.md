    <span>Ricky Bahl (Ranveer Singh), a younger conman makes his monies via duping pretty younger matters &#8212; Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma, Aditi Sharma &#8212; with impunity. Until, the trio decide to take revenge via pitting a con girl &#8212; Anushka Sharma &#8212; in opposition to him. Is it checkmate time or is it time for redemption?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Movie Review: Maneesh Sharma struck the marquee with the offbeat Band Baaja Baraat. Indeed, a yardstick that might be hard to measure as much as. And sure, his 2d film would not genuinely fit the zing and the verve of the primary one.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Firstly, there is no humour, no earthy flavour (don&#8217;t forget the vows on the bread pakora), no tingling chemistry among the lead pair &#8212; the entirety which made the primary movie one of these winner. More importantly, Anushka has a position simplest submit-interval and the first half of is dedicated to his exploits with the alternative 3 ladies. He dupes Parineeti and Aditi through pretending he&#8217;s in love with them, Dipannita by promoting her a faux Hussain portray. And then attempts to con Anushka via selling her vain land at an exorbitant price. But somewhere down the singing and dancing, the duo scouse borrow a kiss and seal a new courting: Voila! It is love before everything kiss. Unconvincing, isn&#8217;t always it?</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>What does paintings in favour of the film are its performances and its non-hysterical tenor. The ladies are a spirited lot and Ranveer is, nicely Ranveer: your common Joe kind of hero who appears convincing enough as Sunny, Deven, Iqbal, Ricky, his sundry avatars. Music through Salim Sulaiman is everyday. A word about Parineeti Chopra: cute.</span>
