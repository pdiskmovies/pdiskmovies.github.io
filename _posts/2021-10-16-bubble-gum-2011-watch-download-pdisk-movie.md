  <span>Meant for folks who need a touchy tryst with cinema that steers clean of cliches and the formulation. Don&#8217;t pass searching out high voltage entertainment and also you may not be disillusioned.</span>

  <span>Story: Vedant and Vidur,&nbsp; teen brothers developing up within the small town of Jamshedpur, experience the approaching-of-age pangs, as their dad and mom (Sachin Khedekar and Tanvi Azmi) try to deal with the dramatic psychological modifications that characterise the turbulent teenagers.

  <span>Movie Review: No excessive drama, no pubescent hysteria, no artifice, no guile&#8230;. Yes, Bubble Gum is a sweet and touchy ode to developing up in an age when there was no Facebook, no internet and no mobiles. Then, in small city India, teen love memories have been made up of cycle chases, wherein younger boys furiously accompanied their lady pals and tried desperately to muster up braveness to make the primary move. Fourteen-12 months-old Vedant&#8217;s love story with Jenny, the neighborhood cop&#8217;s daughter has such an innocence and angst to it, it brings a grin for your lips. Specially whilst there emerges Ratan, a brash and formidable younger rival in love who insists in stealing Jenny away along with his relentless gifts of mint cigarettes and bubble gums. This teenage love tale works most effective because it has such an true feel to it and is poles other than the run-of-the mill youngster romances that spill over from Bollywood&#8217;s meeting line.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>But more than all this, Bubble Gum is a shifting film on parenting, specifically in a case in which one of the kids is physically challenged. Both Tanvi Azmi and Sachin Khedekar create picture best monographs of mother and father who try to address the highs and lows of making a harmonious stability between their&nbsp; youngsters. In a telling sequence, dad Khedekar asks spouse Tanvi who is the actual handicapped youngster: sturdy, stressed, angst-ridden Vedant or hearing-impaired and mature Vidur? Bubble Gum beautifully showcases younger Vedant&#8217;s envy, frustration and anger on the special interest his brother gets and resents the truth that his parents insist he includes his brother in his institution of buddies. Needless to say, the affection between the brothers is unquestionable but the mood swings, the tantrums and the squabbles are equally practical too.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Bubble Gum may not rating excessive at the leisure quotient and is genuinely now not intended for the popcorn guzzlers. But the film has a piquant appeal to it, spilling over with mood, sentiment and message. Add to this, the lifestyles-like performances with the aid of almost all the actors, including the 2 youngster actors (Delzad and Sohail as the listening to-impaired), and you have a film that offers a fulfilling enjoy.</span>
