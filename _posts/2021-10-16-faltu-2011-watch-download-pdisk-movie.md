  <span>Jackky and his pals can&#8217;t discover admission in any college. Easy to understand why&#8230;.They are all proverbial back-benchers with aggregates of 35 in keeping with cent and much less. In order to keep away from the wrath in their mother and father they create a fake university which soon turns into a truth as more and more faltu younger people begin to pour in. Can do-gooder Jackky, at the side of Mr Fix-It, Arshad Warsi and sham main, Riteish Deshmukh offer a direction to the ever developing band of Generation Aimless?</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Movie Review: Does Bollywood provide you 2d chances on the subject of stardom? It does, however handiest in case you are smart sufficient to pick out up a smart new script and a sassy director. Jackky Bhagnani may additionally have was hoping that F.A.L.T.U could undo his disastrous debut in Kal Kissne Dekha, however this faculty caper is bogged down by means of deja vu. You&#8217;ve seen it earlier than, each in Hollywood and Bollywood. And anyhow, all this speak of exchange schooling and cruel dad and mom has been dealt with impeccably in the landmark film, 3 Idiots.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>So, there isn&#8217;t always a lot fun that this bunch of losers can kick up when they come collectively to interrupt policies, defy field and birthday celebration to their own tunes. The children discover a abandoned constructing and a cool benefactor in Arshad Warsi to set up their college which gives all of the fun publications you may consider. The campus becomes a hub in which budding chefs, physical trainers, actors, dancers, style designers, hair dressers, tattoo artists are alleged to hone their talents. But when the digital lectures by using real existence experts truly start, you already know its time to scoot. In case you still loaf around, you would possibly see director Remo D&#8217;Souza recreate his television dance show within the climax. Again definitely pointless, &#8216;coz you&#8217;ve seen all of it earlier than in your non-public TV.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The trouble with F.A.L.T.U lies in its tone. It does not know whether to spread as a full blown comedy or take itself significantly by using offering some gyan at the schooling system. Wish it had selected to remain simply funny. Jackky and his friends rarely constitute GenX, whilst the elders, in particular Akbar Khan, become as caricatures. Both Arshad and Riteish are absolutely indifferent because the supporting solid. The handiest thing to endorse is the music (Jigar-Sachin) that is already creating waves on the audio charts. Can&#8217;t think of a famous disc that does not play Party Abhi Baaki Hai, because the grand finale.</span>
