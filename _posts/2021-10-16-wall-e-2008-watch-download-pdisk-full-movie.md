    <span>There&#8217;s no earthly reason why a studio of Pixar&#8217;s heft should make a film like WALL•E. Richly operating at a profit on every film they&#8217;ve ever made, they have many delighted shareholders and a new supervisor to keep cheerful since they&#8217;re authoritatively important for the Disney empire, and a confiding in audience whose largest protest to date has been that some of their movies have failed to be in a flash work of art and merely managed to be very, very acceptable. In the activity world they&#8217;re unparalleled in clever discourse and nice glossy textures, and everyone would presumably be glad to devour more of the same for quite a long time to come. Well, thank heavens that Pixar appears to have lost some of its business sense, and made a film that is like nothing we&#8217;d expect, except in its quality.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>To some other activity studio &#8211; and this is the reason Pixar can make a reasonable case to being the greatest in cinema history &#8211; WALL•E would not make sense as a mass-market movie. An idea can just have come from energy and motivation, not center gatherings and marketing meetings. Here we have a robot with a jargon that never stretches beyond three words (and those are pronounced with an android stutter); a best friend who&#8217;s a mute cockroach (yuck!), and an obsession with a VHS of Hello, Dolly! (what&#8217;s Hello, Dolly! grandad? Also, who&#8217;s VHS?). What&#8217;s more, he achieves a message being nice to our planet and the evils of enormous enterprises. He would normally belong, best case scenario, as a secondary character, to fall over or pop a wingnut when the plot looks like getting excessively heartfelt.</span>
