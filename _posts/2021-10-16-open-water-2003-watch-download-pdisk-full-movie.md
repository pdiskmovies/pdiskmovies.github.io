    <span>The film depends on evident occasions where two scuba jumpers end up unintentionally abandoned in shark invaded waters after their visit boat departs without them. (Oopsie daisy!)&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film is approximately founded on the occasions experienced by Tom and Eileen Lonergan, who in 1998, were forgotten about in the water close to the Great Barrier Reef after their jump boat team neglected to take an exact headcount, gone forever. (Poop! Did I simply ruin it for you?)&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The film begins watching a couple preparing to go on an excursion, showing their last morning at home prior to taking off, then, at that point showing up at their get-away objective partaking in the sea shore, flaunting bodies, which leads into the evening, where we will see the female lead bare in the entirety of her brilliance, hanging tight for her man to come to bed&#8230;. (Indeed, that was speedy and most likely superfluous, yet workmanship is craftsmanship, right?)&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The opening half-hour or something like that was loaded with waiting imaginative scenes of close ups and minutes in tranquility, while situation unfurl so sluggishly that we were unable to take it any more. I was beginning to assume that once they get abandoned in open water, this sluggish paced strain would have been ideally suited for the circumstance, yet we&#8217;ll never know.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>However, be it as it might, we were so exhausted by the pacing of the opening demonstration that we decided to end our survey insight. The plot for the film is an intriguing perused, just like the record of the couple whom the film depends on.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>We were either genuinely not in the right state of mind the opening demonstration pacing just sucked. Furthermore, they made a spin-off of this??? Simply saying. Be that as it may, taking a gander at the review of the plot, it might have been a superior film&#8230; possibly.</span>
