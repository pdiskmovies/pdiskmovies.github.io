    <span>At first look, Naduvan appears like a own family drama involving an illicit relationship. Bharath plays Karthik, who runs a tea factory, who has little or no time for his spouse Madhu (Aparna Vinod), immersing himself into his work. He employs Guru (Aruvi Bala), a relative, at work and additionally makes him live in his outhouse. Guru finally ends up witnessing Madhu&#8217;s affair with Shiva (Gokul Anand), Karthik&#8217;s pal and associate. Will Guru tell Karthik about this affair? Will Shiva manipulate to get Guru out of the way before that? These are the questions that pressure the first half of the film. We assume aspect-of-the-seat moments from this explosive state of affairs, particularly with the outlet scenes concerning a murder and Karthik saying that he is planning to kill someone, however what we get are instead tame scenes that sense repetitive.</span>

    <span>Director Sharran Kumar wants us to take this material significantly and attempts to interrupt the events into chapters and gives voice-overs about how there is a face at the back of every mask and a story in the back of every face, to make us consider there is extra to the film that meets the attention. But unluckily, this sort of gimmick best smacks of pretentiousness given how uninvolving the scenes are. The movie surely has to become a very distinctive genre movie to keep us engaged. We get a sub-plot regarding Guru and his friends on the manufacturing facility, which unexpectedly will become the principle plot. And we&#8217;re dropped in a domestic invasion mystery territory with Karthik being portrayed as a victim betrayed by way of all the ones he taken into consideration close to and dear.</span>

    <span>Thankfully, the film begins to sense thrilling as soon as it will become a this form of a thriller. However, you hold wishing that the director had spent greater time organising the failed relationship among Karthik and Madhu and his equation with Guru to make us sense the emotional sucker punch that the person could be feeling in the sort of scenario. The performances, too, aren&#8217;t robust sufficient to make us care about those characters. Only Gokul Anand seems to be having fun gambling the wayward Shiva.</span>
