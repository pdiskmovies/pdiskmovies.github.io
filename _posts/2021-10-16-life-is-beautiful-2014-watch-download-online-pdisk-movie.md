    <span>At the point when Raj&#8217;s (Manoj Amarnani) application for Canadian citizenship is dismissed, in a bid to accomplish residency, he is compelled to wed a more interesting, Pia (Anokhi Dalvi). However, his heart longs for Linda (Nancy Brunetta).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Survey: The plot is by all accounts enlivened by famous romantic comedies &#8216;The Proposal&#8217; (2009) and &#8216;What Happens in Vegas&#8217; (2008). Obviously, these Hollywood movies were way prevalent every which way however this one has its own twist or (its absence) and blamelessness.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Set in Canada, &#8216;Superman&#8217; fan-kid Raj (the lovelorn protagonist) works less and fantasizes more with regards to his model-like squash Linda. Then again, &#8216;transitory&#8217; spouse Pia acknowledges she might have created affections for her &#8216;better half&#8217;. What occurs straightaway and who gets whom frames the story.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Entertainer Manoj Amarnani shuffles the numerous jobs of chief, foundation score arranger, choreographer and stylist for the film. He fiddles with nearly everything and notwithstanding being a newbie, figures out how to make a film that is watchable if not paramount.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Taking everything into account, the chief&#8217;s preference for the Yash Chopra-Karan Johar brand of film is clear. Brilliant saris, heartfelt tunes picturised in blanketed regions and dream successions are in abundance. The lead entertainers are kind with the eye and render respectable exhibitions, particularly the saint who has potential yet needs to chip away at his Hindi phrasing.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In any case, what functions as a spoiler here is an inconsequential story that makes the sentiment look unconvincing. The film in this manner functions as a parody as opposed to a romantic tale. However, even the adolescent jokes, which dominatingly rotate around Raj and his companion, get dull inevitably.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The tunes are the film&#8217;s USP for they are pleasant and have been sung by eminent vocalists like Sonu Nigam, Udit Narayan and Shreya Ghoshal. &#8216;Manzilein&#8217; specifically is hummable.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>By and large, the people who are fixated on romantic tales, regardless of how immaterial or customary they are, will wouldn&#8217;t fret watching this one.</span>
