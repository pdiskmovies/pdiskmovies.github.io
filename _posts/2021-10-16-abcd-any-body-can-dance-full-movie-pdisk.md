<span>&#8216;ABCD&#8217; is about a proficient artist, who is incited by the malevolent plan of his manager. He normally demonstrates his guts and arise as a champ!&nbsp;</span>

<span>Subsequent to having a harsh conflict with his companion and chief Jehangir Khan (Kay Menon) about the last&#8217;s barefaced maltreatment of force and impact to win a dance rivalry called &#8220;Dance Dil Se&#8221; for his group JDC (Jehangir Dance Company), the choreographer of the dance organization, Vishnu (Prabhu Deva), leaves his place of employment. From the outset he needs to get back to Chennai, yet his companion Gopi (Ganesh Acharya) convinces him to remain in Mumbai with him. At some point, he notices a few youngsters utilizing parkour to dodge the police. They end up being protégés of Gopi, however regardless of their conspicuous crude ability, they do not have the control needed to become genuine craftsmen; they exhibit this heartbreakingly at a neighborhood occasion for a government official, wherein they set the stage ablaze. Subsequent to seeing similar young fellows showing their moving capacities at Ganpati Chaturthi to beat their adversary area, Vishnu chooses to begin his own dance bunch with them; at last setting them up to contend in &#8220;Dance Dil Se&#8221;. Be that as it may, the absence of order among the artists and the competition between the two groups in the gathering lead by D (Dharmesh Yelande) and Rocky (Salman Yusuff Khan) prompts various imaginative and passionate squares. At first, just Rocky and his posse will go to the free classes, however soon D and his companions float towards the studio.&nbsp;</span>

<span>They are before long joined by Chandu (Punit Pathak), an upset however uncommonly gifted man experiencing an illicit drug use, Shaina (Noorin Sha), a &#8220;bar artist&#8221;, and Rhea (Lauren Gottlieb), a Westerner who was JDC&#8217;s star artist until Jehangir attempted to physically attack her during a &#8220;private guidance&#8221;. While Rhea promptly turns into the new star of the organization, Shaina is bugged as a result of her calling. Regardless of prodding from his friends, Chandu shows a lot of regard for Shaina and protects her before the class and the pair rapidly fall for each other.&nbsp;</span>

<span>Regardless of rehashed requests for harmony in the studio, the two fundamental packs keep on conflicting, driving Vishnu to his absolute limit. Nonetheless, the understudies appear to improve and as an award, he gives them cash to purchase new speakers, however they almost lose it all when Rhea takes them to a world class dance club and challenge the occupant advocate, an expert dance group called &#8220;Invented Crew&#8221;. Vishnu shows up without a second to spare and wins back the cash, yet while his understudies acquire new regard for him, he is enraged with them. After some hard saying &#8216;sorry&#8217; he pardons them and they get back to class with more prominent order and drive, just to out of nowhere be tossed out in the city after D&#8217;s dad calls the cops. During the entirety of this Rocky and Rhea begin to succumb to one another while D ignites with desire. The people group whines that their kids ought not be blending in such a manner and just through an extemporaneous dance execution are the adolescent ready to persuade their groups of the significance of their ability. Just D&#8217;s customary Muslim dad would not acknowledge that his child wants to be an artist.&nbsp;</span>

<span>The team head to Dance Dil Se and tryout, however when Rocky and D battle in front of an audience for Rhea, their shots at showing up on the show in any case appear to be dreary. Jehangir, in a bid to embarrass Vishnu openly, convinces the adjudicators to take the &#8220;Dhongri Dance Revolution&#8221; group on as a &#8220;parody act&#8221;. Confronted with criticize and the possibility that they are a joke and false artists, Vishnu requests that Rocky and D do a stage that requires a lot of trust for both, however they can&#8217;t assemble the trust to oversee it. Vishnu has them pick individuals they would trust to play out the progression with, however then, at that point stunts the two artists by blindfolding them and having them endeavor it once more; this time, they are effective, and the two groups start to trust one another and cooperate. Not well before the finals, Chandu plans to propose to Shaina, yet he meets his old street pharmacist in the city.&nbsp;</span>

<span>Presently totally liberated from the hold of medications, he will not fall once more into that world, however the vendor, disturbed, thumps the ring planned for Shaina into the road. As he recovers it, Chandu is hit by a truck and killed, leaving the group crushed. Shaina, however scarcely ready to remain from anguish, turns into the focal point of the group&#8217;s semi-last everyday practice, in which they express the deficiency of their companion, carrying crowd individuals to tears. The group and the local area meet up to cover Chandu, and DDR takes steps to proceed in the opposition in his memory.&nbsp;</span>

<span>At the finals, Jehangir pulls a grimy stunt: his witness Mayur (an entertainer in DDR in any case, enticed by Jehangir&#8217;s proposal of a primary lead job in JDC started to take care of data to the resistance) has requested his artists to duplicate the adversary group&#8217;s movement and execution idea. Confronted with losing, DDR makes another daily schedule on the spot, based around Lord Ganesha. Their genuine and unconstrained presentation reminds the inhumane Jehangir why he and Vishnu began JDC in any case and is lowered as the DDR team are compensated with loud praise and triumph in the opposition.</span>
