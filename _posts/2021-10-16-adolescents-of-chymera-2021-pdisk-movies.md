    <span>This is not a Hollywood mainstream or MCU film, but one of a modest budget that depicts a compelling story and acted realistically by good young actors.</span>

    <span>Inspired by true events, it&#8217;s main character, Roy (played by Josh Keaton), is simply trying to avoid juvenile hall as he adjust to life in militant group home where other troubled teens stay. During his stay, Roy is forced to conform to strict house rules, deal with his over the top roommate, Lucky (played by Danny Arroyo), and hide his love affair with fellow teen Laura (played by Chloe Taylor).</span>

    <span>In the end, the lessons learned are hard ones. Not all are fair or just, but this film tries to show that life can be what you make of it, and sometimes just believing you are more than your surroundings can carry you through the tough times.</span>
