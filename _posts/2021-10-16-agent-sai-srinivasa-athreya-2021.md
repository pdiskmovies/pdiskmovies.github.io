    <span>Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya (Naveen Polishetty) is a splendid, underestimated analyst from Nellore who runs an organization called FBI which sees no business. He gets more than what he requested when a case ends up falling solidly into his lap all of a sudden.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Survey: Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya is a splendidly executed, straightforward film which makes it clear from get-approach the sort of story it needs to tell. This isn&#8217;t the sort of film that will pander to a business crowd, nor is it the sort of film which will permit itself to be weakened with pointless sayings. There will be no vibe acceptable minutes to make your chest untighten when the gristly center of the story shows it face nor there any help toward the finish to cause it to appear to be that everything is squarely on the planet. This is actually why Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya is the sort of film that should be seen with a story that should be told.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Agent Athreya (Naveen Polishetty) is a criminal investigator lamenting his dead mother and running an analyst organization called FBI (you will need to watch the film to realize why it&#8217;s named all things considered) from a vegetable market in Nellore. In the limits of stripping divider paint and glinting bulbs, Agent Athreya and his associate Sneha (Sruthi) settle cases that are unmistakably underneath him, however it&#8217;s everything he can get. He accepts his standing goes before him and his splendid yet funny brain longs for convoluted cases. In middle of an un-ideal circumstance, Agent Athreya ends up risking upon simply that – a tragic case that merits his time if by some stroke of good luck for the lamenting dad. However, as he starts joining the spots, something undeniably more evil is uncovered.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya is the sort of film that behaves like a gradual process. You go in expecting a couple of jokes to a great extent and possibly a case that is not as muddled as the one you&#8217;re shown, however something that our legend figures out how to address and make all the difference. Furthermore, that is the way it starts as well. The film takes as much time as is needed giving you subtleties you don&#8217;t realize you will require later and setting up characters, particularly with Agent Athreya&#8217;s origin story. The speed genuinely makes one restless and you really can&#8217;t help thinking about why you&#8217;re being given this load of subtleties that steer clear of the current case. However, chief Swaroop and Naveen (who co-composed the screenplay) figure out how to pull the rug directly from under your feet and you&#8217;re left thinking about what you just played observer to. To uncover much else about the story would be an extraordinary shamefulness, for it is something that really should be seen on-screen.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Movies like these – an honest to goodness investigator thrill ride – are typically let somewhere around escape clauses, particularly when they&#8217;re founded on wrongdoing that happens, all things considered, each day. Does Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya have no escape clauses? Possibly it does, yet Swaroop and Naveen keep you so occupied; you truly don&#8217;t have the opportunity to contemplate everything, in any event, during the draggy bits. Naveen makes an awesome presentation as a lead with this one and really appears to live in the skin of his person. There&#8217;s not one scene that causes you to appear as though he&#8217;s awkward and keeping in mind that he obviously experts through the funny pieces, it&#8217;s the scenes that expect him to show feeling that gets you ignorant. Shruti as Sneha is great, however this is Naveen and his person Athreya&#8217;s show as far as possible. Suhas makes a great appearance as Detective Bobby, Athreya&#8217;s Tamil partner.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>While Swaroop conveys a sound film, Mark K Robin&#8217;s music and Sunny Kurapati&#8217;s cinematography assist with setting the state of mind in numerous scenes. Watch the film this end of the week if straightforward analyst thrill rides are your favorite thing in the world; watch this one perpetually so in case you&#8217;re jonesing for some for something new that will make you think. You will love it!</span>
