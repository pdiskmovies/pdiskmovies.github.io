    <span>Design photographic artist Armaan has an excessive number of issues within reach. There&#8217;s a high support sweetheart, Gehna who is the manager of the design magazine he works for and a plenty of ghosts who need him to satisfy their desires, since no one but he can see and speak with them. Things settle the score more muddled when Gehna starts to despise the other worldy interruptions and really questions her beau&#8217;s psychological health&#8230;.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: Arshad Warsi&#8217;s introduction film as essayist and maker has an issue at the beginning. It neglects to characterize itself. Is it a satire, a romantic tale or an otherworldly show? Does it have a highlight make, other than engage?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>The main inquiry raises its head in light of the fact that the plot and the tenor of the film meander excessively. Infrequently entertaining, for the most part nostalgic, the film appears to die comic potential for some dramatization doesn&#8217;t exactly lock in. While the experiences with the ghosts, headed by Boman Irani, start in a lighter vein, they out of nowhere appear to enter contact feely an area, with Arshad Warsi, the person who can see dead individuals, crying extensive tears while uniting children and fathers, children and moms, married couples. A valid example: Suddenly, out of nowhere, you have a young man ghost stumbling into swarmed roads, encouraging Arshad to save his perishing daddy. Hi! Where did he come from; what&#8217;s his story? They do advise you, yet it&#8217;s excessively unexpected and makes you can&#8217;t help thinking about why Arshad is sobbing his direction through a grouping that scarcely contacts you. Once more, the mother ghost chasing for her four-year-old child is excessively wet and excessively unsurprising. The solitary ghost-ghost ka dost succession that really works is the Boman-Arshad track, wherein a dead Boman needs Arshad to fix things for his abused spouse (Asavari Joshi). Yet, tragically, that is brief.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Which carries us to the second inquiry regarding the significance of the film. Well that is a significant question, since chief Kabeer Kaushik and Arshad Warsi have another film surprisingly: Seher. A hard-hitting cop story, Seher actually waits in memory as among Arshad&#8217;s best demonstrations, aside from being a straightforward uncover of the rail mafia in UP. We wouldn&#8217;t pose this inquiry if Hum Tum aur Ghost functioned as an unadulterated parody or perhaps as the other &#8216;I see dead individuals film&#8217; (read a heavenly spine chiller like The Sixth Sense). It doesn&#8217;t, and all we are left with are a couple of groupings of fun, trailed by since quite a while ago drawn show.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>With regards to exhibitions, it&#8217;s the Arshad-Boman science that pops and contributes the film with shimmer and mind. Dia Mirza also has her minutes as the lively sweetheart while Sandhya Mridul winds up generally squandered as a companion. What&#8217;s considerably more baffling is Shankar-Ehsan-Loy&#8217;s sound track which neglects to hurl a solitary hummable tune.</span>
