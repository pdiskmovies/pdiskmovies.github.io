    <span>This Roger Spottiswoode-coordinated feature relates the genuine biography of a harmed stray tabby cat named Bob who adopted destitute medication addict James Bowen (Luke Treadaway) and turned his life around in the most spectacular fashion – together, they&#8217;ve sold 5,000,000 books. Up until now, so upbeat: yet while Bob lurks around some predictable narrative beats, this is as yet a shrewdly rebellious film with a social highlight make as it features James&#8217; isolation in a cool, hard-faced London which reacts preferable to animals over its miserable humans.&nbsp;</span>

      <p>
        A standout performance from Luke Treadaway gives A Street Cat Named Bob some surprisingly sharp teeth. The achievement of web cat-fancying sensations (Bob, Grumpy Cat, et al) may lead forthcoming watchers to track down a moggy form of Marley and Me (they share the same UK distributer), however this is a franker portrayal of the extreme story behind the Youtube sensation including the revulsions of methadone withdrawal. Subsequently, theatrical achievement may be a more subtle rat for Bob to chase down, and A Street Cat Named Bob could settle down best as a home animal.&nbsp;

        <span>Treadaway dominates as the damaged methadone addict inverse a suitably appealing presentation from Bob himself in help (and various Bob stand-ins). Those expecting a vibe decent onslaught will find something more nuanced, although Street Cat hits all the predictable emotional beats including a hesitant romance and an emotional family reconciliation amidst James&#8217; battle to reconnect with his life.&nbsp;</span>

      <div>
        <span>The main appeal of A Street Cat Named Bob is its converse narrative – this man may protect a cat yet, in reality, it&#8217;s the cat who saves the man&#8217;s life. The actual books are slight – James discovers Bob, Bob recognizes a mouse, Bob gets microchipped – and Spotiswoode, working from a screenplay by Tim John and Maria Nation, has more than the issues of working with animals to deal with here. He lays everything out carefully in this 102-minute film, taking time before Bob even wanders into the frame.&nbsp;</span>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            A fragile James (Treadaway) is first seen busking in a wet Covent Garden before he gluts – as he&#8217;s on a methadone program, taking any heroin is potentially fatal for this street-sleeper. His harried case laborer, played by Downton Abbey&#8217;s Joanne Froggatt, sees his potential to reemerge society, and pushes for James to be moved to protected accommodation on a dreary North London estate where he experiences the composite character Betty (Ruta Gedmintas) a nutty vegan potential love interest and, all the more successfully, Bob the cat.&nbsp;

          <div>
            <span>Treadaway carries a vulnerability to his portrayal of Surrey-conceived James, who was abandoned by his father (Anthony Head) and diagnosed with bi-polar turmoil and ADHD as a youngster in Australia. He makes it easy to perceive how a man can become cut off from the world, and how life can rapidly stack facing him as part of an army of anonymous of street-sleepers in London&#8217;s cool climate – crueler now than when these occasions occurred in 2007.&nbsp;</span>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <span>In fact, there are times when A Street Cat Named Bob looks more like a scene from Mike Leigh&#8217;s Naked than the adorable Youtube busker-and-cat video where this entire sensation started out.&nbsp;</span>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <span>At the point when Bob demands following James &#8220;to work&#8221; on a leash, sitting patiently on his head or in his guitar case as he busks, it gradually carries James back in contact with humanity (as exemplified by Ruth Sheen as a fan of Bob&#8217;s who proffers tins of tuna and sewed scarves).&nbsp;</span>
          </div>
          
          <blockquote>
            <div>
              <span>This isn&#8217;t always easy: moving to function as a merchant of The Big Issue, James lands in some extreme turf wars. All through, he battles to get totally clean. Groupings with the effervescent Betty don&#8217;t combine very well with this abrasive narrative, although Gedmintas is a warm presence in a dramatic gadget. Dad Anthony Head&#8217;s character is also meagerly extended around a couple banalities. The consummation is gratifyingly upbeat, as each and every individual who enters the cinema will already know.&nbsp;</span>

          <div>
            <span>Spottiswoode&#8217;s technical team pleasantly captures a down-at-heel, wet, gray and inhospitable London, mellowing as our protagonist makes the excursion back to existence with the assistance of his grave companion Bob. Whatever about nine lives, A Street Cat Named Bob it may track down its best audience on home review after a splashy royal UK debut through Sony – attended by the Duchess of Cambridge, no less &#8211; and a US release on November 18. It&#8217;s clear here that James Bowen hasn&#8217;t failed to remember his kindred victims, or the individuals who helped him, and the film may rub hard against social still, small voices as austerity Britain thumps facing another chilly Christmas.</span>
