  <span>Jerry Patel (Akshay Kumar) and Nick Mathur (John Abraham), two victims of the worldwide recession in UK are jobless and clueless about their destiny, notwithstanding having arduous responsibilities to shoulder. Jerry should look after his sister’s orphan little son and Nick has a excessive protection lady friend (Deepika Padukone) looking for fast matrimony. Desperate instances pressure them to searching for determined measures for survival and that they meet Sanjay Dutt who hires them as male escorts in his recession-proof employer, Desi Boyz. Will our million dollar male escorts meet their responsibilities with their new and doubtful credentials?</span>

  <span>Movie Review: It’s the crackling chemistry between John Abraham and Akshay Kumar which makes Desi Boyz any such fun movie. The man bonding among them had already been showcased in Garam Masala however this movie consists of the camaraderie even similarly. True, the film doesn’t boast of something that even comes near an shrewd quotient, but the perfectly tuned tango, salsa, hip hop between the boyz gives it a highly spiced aspect and keeps you for your seats, goofily munching your popcorns.</span>

  <span>John’s Nick, a excessive profile MBA from the London School of Economics, is the formidable types who dreams of the first-rate suburban life, with a beautiful spouse (Deepika Padukone), two kids, a canine and a giant bank stability. His lady friend too believes that lifestyles can&#8217;t be lived on a mere bird roll. Akshay’s Jerry is the greater earthy sorts, satisfied to eke out a residing as a mall attendant, so long as he&#8217;s able to share his highs and lows along with his nice pal and housemate, Nick. It’s Jerry who forces a reluctant Nick to sign up for Sanjay Dutt’s Desi Boyz corporation, whilst the ugly face of unemployment stares them in their face. Naturally, with their function abs and biceps, it doesn’t take them lengthy to grow to be the hottest beefcake in town and lifestyles appears to be a curler coaster journey.Until Nick’s girl friend discovers them pole dancing and the social security officer sends Jerry’s push back to foster dad and mom. Time for turning the page and getting again to true, right and moral lifestyles.</span>

  <span>Debutant director Rohit Dhawan tells his story in a light vein and in no way compromises at the a laugh quotient. He appeared to have learnt his craft from his father, David Dhawan, nicely, but by no means performs it over the pinnacle like him. Moreover, he keeps the drama dizzily transferring on and peppers it with a feisty screenplay, with a few humorous one-liners thrown in right here and there. The telepathic communication among John and Akshay is in particular humourous and handiest augments their chemistry. Pritam’s song is full of verve and the name music, Desi Boyz, has already become a chartbuster. The girls, Deepika and Chitrangada perhaps eye sweet, but they&#8217;re delicious, succulent and sizzling. If Deepika’s act is eyeball-grabbing, then Chitrangada’s Economic’s professor who sheds her clothes for every right answer is the stuff that dreams are product of: isn’t it guys! But in the end, ladies, this one is for you. Too tons sizzle on screen. End result: Can’t take your eyes off.</span>
