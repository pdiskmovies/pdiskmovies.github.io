    <span>The film is tipped to be an action-drama, which draws its strength initially from the appearance of Jagapati Babu as a ultra-stylish, uber-cool hunk killing hooligans. In that sense, the first half is committed generally to action episodes. However, it is in the second a large portion of that director Vasu Parimi proves his guts. The manner in which he has dealt with the emotional scenes among Patel and his family will give you goosebumps. Ironically, for a film that baited the audience with its action scenes, it is the emotional drama that stands apart in the end. Also, Jagapati Babu has worked effectively in those scenes. Aamani in her brief role is acceptable as is Tanya Hope as special officer Katherine, assigned to track the murders. Padmapriya as Vallabh&#8217;s wife is kind with the eye. Subhalekha Sudhakar as Patel&#8217;s friend plays a simple part while the villain&#8217;s (Kabir Khan) portrayal is rather stereotypical.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The background score is in keeping with the mind-set of the film. Each frame has been beautifully captured by the cinematographer. Yet, similarly as with most action-dramas, the plot becomes predictable and this results in a decent however soul-less first-half. However, director Vasu more than makes up for it in the subsequent half. Jagapati Babu is simply fantastic and literally carries the film on his shoulders. What&#8217;s more, he ought to certainly express gratitude toward Vasu for giving him a character with immense extension for performance. In recent times, he has become well known with antagonist roles yet in this one, he leaves an imprint as an actor of substance in the true sense. &#8216;Patel S.I.R&#8217; is definitely worth a watch.</span>
