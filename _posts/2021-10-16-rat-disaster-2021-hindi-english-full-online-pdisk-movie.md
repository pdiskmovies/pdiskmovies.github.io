    <span>Junkrat Train is a 2021 Chinese activity thriller about a traveler train that is assaulted by many pillaging rats. Otherwise called Rat Disaster and Rat Train.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>A Chinese Department of Health junior assistant Su Zhenghuai (Yu Zhaode) is with his oldest little girl Su Wei (Xia Yiyi) and child Su Yuexuan (Chu Yuga) are headed to see family members in the common city when they meet the tragically missing second little girl Su Ling (Juya).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Shockingly, the train is assaulted by rats. Su Yuexuan is chomped by a rat and goes into a state of unconsciousness. To save his young child and many nibbled travelers, Su Zhenghuai and Su Wei choose to make the risky dare to Xiaobaihe Hospital to get medication…&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Like most Chinese movies, Junkrat Train experiences exceptionally conflicting, and habitually shoddy CGI. A portion of the locations of bunches of rats in the city roads work, however generally, the impacts simply don&#8217;t work. The blast close to the film&#8217;s end is especially terrible [… ] If you can manage that and some sermonizing minutes from the content Junkrat Train will kill an hour and a half sensibly well</span>.
