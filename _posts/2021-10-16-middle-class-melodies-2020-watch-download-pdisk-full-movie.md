## middle class melodies 2021 movie review

<div>
  <div>
    <span>It is difficult to review when was the last time a Telugu film made them grin from the primary scene to the last. Debutant Vinod Anantoju&#8217;s Middle Class Melodies, which is as of now gushing on Amazon Prime, is unarguably one of the most beguiling movies to emerge from Telugu film as of late. Set in a humble community close to Guntur, this is a straightforward, near reality story of affection, dreams and harmony. At the point when most producers fantasy about making amazing film on rich financial plans, here&#8217;s a film that turns that thought on its head and demonstrates that when you recount a straightforward story with all heart and as genuinely as could be expected, it&#8217;ll evoke an emotional response from the crowd.&nbsp;</span>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Middle Class Melodies follows Raghava (Anand Deverakonda), who works with his folks in their family-run lodging in Kolakalur, a little town close to Tenali. Raghava, similar to each and every other youth nowadays, longs for a city life and plans on setting up an inn (since he thinks he makes the best &#8216;Bombay&#8217; chutney) in Guntur yet his dad (a fantastically decent Goparaju Ramana) is against the thought. Regardless of whether Raghava prevails with regards to opening an inn in Guntur structures the essence of the story.&nbsp;

      <div>
        <span>However, Middle Class Melodies isn&#8217;t just with regards to Raghava and his fantasy about setting up a lodging. It&#8217;s likewise about some vital characters in Kolakalur. It&#8217;s with regards to Gopal, who plays Raghava&#8217;s companion, and his fixation on horoscopes. It&#8217;s with regards to an old Anjaiah, the nearby milkman, and his determination to send his granddaughter to school. It&#8217;s with regards to Sandhya and her affection for Raghava, who is her &#8216;bava&#8217;. It&#8217;s with regards to Lakshmi and Kamala, two mother characters and their job in the existences of their spouses and youngsters. It&#8217;s additionally about Gautami and how she without any assistance upholds her family while managing her lush dad. It&#8217;s with regards to Nageswara Rao and his main goal to get his girl wedded into a pleasant family.&nbsp;</span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>What truly makes Middle Class Melodies special is that it&#8217;s anything but a story pretty much the legend. It&#8217;s pretty much every one of the characters who help the legend (a certain Anand Deverakonda) in his excursion to set up a lodging all alone. Rather than maintaining the emphasis just on the legend and his excursion, the film gives plentiful screen space and significance to the supporting characters that make Middle Class Melodies so essential and profoundly engaging. The unassuming community milieu is caught beautifully and as genuinely as could be expected. It&#8217;s so near reality that you feel like you&#8217;re sitting with the characters and having a near heart discussion.</span>
