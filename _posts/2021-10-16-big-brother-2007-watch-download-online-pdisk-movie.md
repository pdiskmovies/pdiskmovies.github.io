    Sachidanandan gets delivered from jail subsequent to carrying out a twofold life punishment. While he presently needs to carry on with an existence with his family, his past before long finds him, compelling him to take measures to ensure his precious ones.&nbsp;

    Audit: Director Siddique&#8217;s motion pictures that have worked have consistently had an equivalent blend of humor, activity and opinions. In his most recent movie, notwithstanding, the chief, who has additionally prearranged the film has dropped the humor component for more activity and a tolerance testing plot to make look like a thrill ride.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    The film&#8217;s hero 40-year-old Sachidanandan (Mohanlal) is simply delivered from jail subsequent to carrying out a twofold life punishment for killing a cop at an adolescent home. His family, notwithstanding, greets him wholeheartedly and inside the initial 30 minutes, he uncovers to them that he wasn&#8217;t simply serving time the previous 24 years. To up the anticipation remainder, Siddique has likewise given his hero a unique expertise that helps him in the film&#8217;s different activity scenes that remember two for the dim and one smack in the center of a dustbowl.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Sachidanandan&#8217;s past, nonetheless, before long gets up to speed to him and his family, and driving him to get back to the manners in which he would not like to. In this is a cop Vedantham IPS (Arbaaz Khan) who is on the chase for a tricky medication supervisor Edwin Moses. How Sachidanandan&#8217;s, Vedantham&#8217;s and Moses&#8217; ways cross is what&#8217;s going on with the movie, yet Siddique selects to utilize such countless sayings and confusion methods to arrive that before its finish, the crowd could scarcely mind what moses&#8217; identity is and what his definitive point is.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Mohanlal as Sachidanandan is dreary looked for the greater part of the film, aside from the comic scenes where he attempts to notice the comforts after his life in jail. Indeed, a greater amount of these scenes might have raised the film. Arbaaz as Vedantham IPS has an amazing presence, yet is underused. His equal story appears to lose all sense of direction in the wreck that Sachidanandan and companions get entrapped in, and the cop turns into a contrite reference, best case scenario.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    The film&#8217;s driving women Mirnaa, Honey Rose and Gadha do their parts well in what restricted scenes they have. Anoop Menon and Sarjano Khalid as Sachidanandan&#8217;s siblings Vishnu and Manu, individually, perform nicely. The parody track from Vishnu Unnikrishnan, Tini Tom and Irshad crash and burn, be that as it may.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Deepak Dev&#8217;s melodies in the film add a bit of energy that the film, which is 164 minutes in length, frantically required. In the event that Siddique might have held the run-time under control and possibly avoided assembling Sachidanandan as a superhuman, the film might have passed as a good watch.
