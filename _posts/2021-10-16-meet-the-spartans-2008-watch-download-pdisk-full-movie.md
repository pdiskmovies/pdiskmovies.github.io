    <span>So much has been expounded on the homoeroticism in the film &#8220;300&#8221; that any farce will undoubtedly feel like pointless excess. Luckily, needless excess is the thing that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer do best: as the uncontested titans of the farce class (with fingers in everything from the &#8220;Terrifying Movie&#8221; establishment to the later &#8220;Epic Movie&#8221;) they keep on demonstrating that disparaging other movies is a lot simpler than making your own.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>In &#8220;Meet the Spartans,&#8221; King Leonidas (Sean Maguire, whose complement veers from London to Glasgow and back once more) and 13 reliable sweethearts  er, warriors  go head to head against the Persians and a torrential slide of mainstream society garbage. While a skanky Queen Margo (Carmen Electra, obviously) attempts to occupy the men from each other, big name not really copies and unfunny unscripted TV drama departures strive for our focus and gag reflex.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>As excess and bland as Queen Margo&#8217;s crab-plagued virtue belt, &#8220;Meet the Spartans&#8221; is best depicted by the responses of a column of what seemed, by all accounts, to be 6th graders who imparted the screening to me. As different Spartans slipped each other the tongue (Eewwww!), an areola cinch was ripped off with the areola actually connected (Aaarghh!) and the Spartans jumped into fight singing &#8220;I Will Survive&#8221; (Huh?), I understood the children had said everything.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>&#8220;Meet the Spartans&#8221; is evaluated PG-13 (Parents emphatically advised). It has flying false teeth, a pretentious penguin and human balls spread with canine food.</span>
