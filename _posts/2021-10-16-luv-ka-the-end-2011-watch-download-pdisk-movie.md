    <span>Rhea (Shraddha Kapoor) needs to praise her eighteenth birthday celebration in an extremely unique manner. Appears to be her fantasy may very well worked out as expected when her rich sweetheart, Luv Nanda (Taaha Shah) guarantees her a night she&#8217;ll always remember. For sure, the night ends up being extraordinary, however not the manner in which Rhea envisioned. Vengeance, not love turns into the leitmotif of the astounding evening, as the 18-year-old attempts to vindicate her embarrassment and show her creep beau a couple of kick-ass examples he&#8217;ll always remember.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: This one is sentiment in invert. What&#8217;s more, that is the main curiosity the film can brag about. While most Bollywood romantic tales arrive at a fulfillment, Love Ka The End works hotly &#8211; and absurdly &#8211; towards affection&#8217;s devastation.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>It was a unique thought which might have investigated the fiery new age that is swarming the huge urban areas and unassuming communities of advancing India. It&#8217;s a cheeky, brilliant, forceful age that will not take poo from anybody, no matter what. Love clearly isn&#8217;t about sweet forfeits any longer. On the off chance that things turn out badly, the strategy is quick vengeance. Furthermore, why not&#8230;.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Extraordinary thought, helpless execution: that is the incongruity of this film which vows to launch Yash Raj Films as the MTV of the entertainment world. However, hello, the frightful and brutish babalog of the various MTV unscripted TV dramas actually look similar to genuine Genxer&#8217;s, notwithstanding their overstated brattish ways. Here, the bundle of school kids need both IQ and EQ and barely appear to be valid. Alright, so there are a lot of richie rich playboys out there, holding back to go after guiltless Red Riding Hoods for their eminence and friend pressure. Slime bucket very rich person kid, Luv Nanda might treat love-struck Rhea&#8217;s virginity as a product to wager upon. No issues up until now. In any case, with regards to Rhea&#8217;s retribution plan, the film gets so ditzy, you couldn&#8217;t say whether it&#8217;s really occurring. Come on folks, our young grown-ups are a lot more astute than pouring tingling powder in underwear and all that added to the-repertoire stuff&#8230;.Add to that the strange peak and the much promoted &#8216;sheep melody&#8217; and you end up frantically sending a SOS to Yash Chopra.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Daag, Deewar, Kabhi Kabhie, Trishul, Silsila, Chandni, Darr, Dil To Paagal Hai, Veer Zaara, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&#8230;.Love Ka The End (these are a portion of the movies delivered by Yash Raj Films): Come back, Yashji!&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The film scores just in a portion of its exhibitions (Shraddha Kapoor&#8217;s posse) and might engage youthful collegiates who need to miss a couple of exhausting instructional exercises.</span>
