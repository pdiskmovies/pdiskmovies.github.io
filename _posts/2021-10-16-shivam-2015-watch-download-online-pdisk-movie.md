    <span>Shiva (Ram), a so called love master has some expertise in joining couples whose families go against their adoration. At the point when he succumbs to a young lady, there are a great deal of obstacles he needs to survive. And afterward, Shiva isn&#8217;t Shiva all things considered!&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Film Review: Tollywood films are perpetually reiterated renditions of old stories and Ram&#8217;s Shivam is the same. The exhausted &#8216;old wine in another jug&#8217; assortment yet unfortunately, bundling ain&#8217;t so new.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>You have a kid Shiva (Ram) who experiences passionate feelings for a young lady Tanu (Raashi). Shiva will go to any length for the young lady he adores – he hops off a train the first occasion when he &#8216;sees&#8217; her (ludicrously wearing her glamourous best – in a long outfit – in what is by all accounts a town in Kurnool! She is yelling &#8216;I love you&#8217; on the highest point of her lungs to an irregular person (Ram) going in a train) He will battle thugs to keep her out of risk. Added to that is his temperament of assisting sweethearts with joining at all chances. He is our ideal legend.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>And afterward, the setting is wonderful as well. While toward one side is a town with a malignant boss, Boji Reddy (Vineet Kumar) who the saint annoys, on the other is a wear (Abhimanyu Singh) who needs to wed the courageous woman since he thinks she is fortunate for him! Indeed, been there, seen that? Gracious! Also, one can&#8217;t neglect to make reference to an old flashback which increases the value of the generally confounding story. While the rewind helps clear an uncertainty or two, before the finish of the 168-minute-run-time, you will have a greater number of inquiries than answers in your mind. There are multitudinous lose closes. For example, for what reason does Ram&#8217;s dad Posani blow up at whatever point his name manifests?&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Shivam is the sort of film which can&#8217;t put money on its story to draw in groups and components of amusement could be the solitary deliverer. In any case, that doesn&#8217;t occurred and we are left taking a gander at the saint mouthing the exaggerated punch discoursed and satire which is dry to the point that solitary the over energetic individuals from the crowd will appreciate.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Smash&#8217;s portrayal is by all accounts approximately motivated from Ravi Teja&#8217;s Kalyan in Kick. He is given organization by reprobates who are a lighthearted element of sorts and afterward humorists who do that too at any rate. Characters abruptly disappear from the story giving it a fragmented feel – like Thagubothu Ramesh who is one among a gathering of folks who seek after Raashi is no place to be seen after a specific point. Boji Reddy&#8217;s child who is the focal point of the film&#8217;s contention becomes imperceptible sooner or later.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Raashi Khanna&#8217;s newness goes for a throw graciousness the person which does no equity to her ability. The solitary redeeming quality in this film are the melodies which picturised well overall. With everything taken into account the film is incredibly extended, excessively normal and exceptionally exhausting.</span>
