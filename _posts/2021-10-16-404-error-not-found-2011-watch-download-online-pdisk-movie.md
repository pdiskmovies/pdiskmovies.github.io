  <span>Like pretty much every fresher, Abhimanyu (Rajwir Aroraa) enters clinical school with regular expectation and goal. It doesn&#8217;t take some time before he turns into a survivor of ragging. Might have been alright, just if his senior, Chris (Imaad Shah) hadn&#8217;t requested him to explore the life and times from an understudy who ended it all in the inn. Abhimanyu starts on a courageous note and picks to live in the vacant, apparently spooky room, however soon things get creepy. Will the in-house and acclaimed specialist (Nishikant Kamath) keep the realist in him alive?&nbsp;</span>

  <span>Film Review: Thank God our producers have quit underestimating the crowd and have started to credit them an IQ separated from an EQ. Obviously, keen film is as yet an extraordinariness in our entertainment world. Be that as it may, there are a modest bunch of movies, once in a while, which don&#8217;t request you abandon your minds. Prawaal Raman&#8217;s 404 is one of them.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The highpoint of the film lies in the way that it investigates paranormal movement without forsaking science and objectivity. What&#8217;s more, that in reality is an uncommon accomplishment. Set against the scenery of a clinical school, the film takes up the standard issues of ragging and understudy suicides however gives it a particularly tart wind, you end up in a real sense KOed.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The way that the film continues at a sluggish speed likewise works in support of its, adding a bit of authenticity to the dramatization. Indeed, no where does the story lose its practical feel, be it as far as setting, portrayal or exhibitions. Indeed, the exhibitions are so life-like, it appears you have fraternized with the characters some place or the other. Rajwir Aroraa&#8217;s new kid act is convincing, as he develops from class saint to grounds weirdo, in the wake of holding discussions with dainty air before him. Imaad Shah as the cryptic senior domineering jerk is in heavenly structure, making an evil presence, with no craziness or promotion. A significant regular, this youthful entertainer. Satish Kaushik as the avuncular superintendent who is only a half-realist is warm and watchable. In any case, it is Nishikant Kamath&#8217;s depiction of the inhabitant therapist which winds up as the unexpected bundle of the film. Kamath, who gave us the essential Mumbai Meri Jaan, makes a fine introduction as an entertainer with 404.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>A word about the cinematography: Savita Singh makes a creepy material, without depending on contrivances, even as chief Prawaal Raman gives you a film that stays with you, long after blind call. 404 is an extraordinary jump from Rawal&#8217;s Darna series: Darna Mana Hai, Darna Zaroori Hai.</span>
