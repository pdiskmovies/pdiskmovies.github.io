  <span>Bollywood musicals are the Swiss Army Knives of the cinema, with a tool for each task: comedy, drama, track and dance, farce, pathos, journey, top notch scenery, improbably handsome heroes, tooth-gnashing villains, marriage-obsessed mothers and their tragically single daughters, who are always ethereal beauties.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>&#8220;You get the whole thing in one film,&#8221; my buddy Uma de Cuhna informed me, as she took me to look &#8220;Taal&#8221; in Hyderabad. &#8220;No need to run around right here and there, searching out a musical or an action photo.&#8221; The film lasted greater than 3 hours, along with an intermission, which Uma hired by correctly predicting the whole lot that could appear in the course of the rest of the film.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Bollywood, is, of direction, Bombay &#8212; or Mumbai, as it&#8217;s miles now referred to as, although there has been no movement to rename the style Mumblywood. Although Western exhibitors aren&#8217;t crazy about a movie they could best show two times a night time, rather than 3 instances, Bollywood has developed a wholesome target audience in London, where the Bollywood Oscars were held a year ago. Now comes &#8220;Bride and Prejudice,&#8221; which adds the BritLit genre to the combination.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Directed by means of Gurinder Chadha, whose &#8220;What&#8217;s Cooking?&#8221; (2000) and &#8220;Bend It Like Beckham&#8221; (2002) make you smile simply thinking about them, that is a unfastened-spirited edition of the Jane Austen novel, in which Mr. Darcy and the single sisters and their family are plugged right into a contemporary plot that spans London, New York, Bombay and Goa. Darcy is an American performed by way of Martin Henderson, and Lizzie Bennett becomes Lalita Bakshi, second of 4 daughters in Amritsar, India &#8212; actual to Austen, a country city.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Lalita is played by using Aishwarya Rai, Miss World of 1994, recently described by at least one movie critic (me) as now not simplest the primary but additionally the second maximum beautiful female in the international. According to the Internet Movie Database, &#8220;The Queen of Bollywood&#8221; is so popular she become surely capable of break out with appearing in advertisements for each Coke and Pepsi. I additionally study she carried the Olympic Torch in 2004, has a pup named Sunshine, and was indexed by Time as one of the 100 maximum influential humans inside the international. If this assessment is not followed by a picture of her, you have got grounds for a lawsuit.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Aishwarya (ash-waar-e-ah) Rai exudes not the horrifying seriousness of a lady who thinks she is being attractive, however the grace and ease of a girl who knows she is fun to take a look at and be round. What a smile. What eyes. Rai isn&#8217;t always remotely overweight, however nor is she alarmingly skinny; having deliberately won 20 pounds for this role, she is the flower of exceptional vitamins.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Sorry, I got a bit distracted there. Chadha, who become born in Kenya, raised in London, and is married to a Japanese-American, seems interested in ethnic multi-tasking. Her &#8220;What&#8217;s Cooking?&#8221; is ready in Los Angeles and tells parallel tales about families with Vietnamese, African-American, Mexican and Jewish roots. &#8220;Bend It Like Beckham&#8221; was about a London woman from a Kenyan circle of relatives with Punjabi roots, who wants to play soccer.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>In &#8220;Bride and Prejudice&#8221; she all over again transcends barriers. This isn&#8217;t always a Bollywood movie, but a Hollywood musical comedy incorporating Bollywood elements. Her characters burst into music and dance on the slightest provocation, subsidized up with the aid of a dance corps that materializes with the second one verse and disappears on the end of the scene. That&#8217;s Bollywood. So is the emphasis at the mother and father; the lovers in most American romantic comedies seem to be orphans. And she employs the Bollywood approach for the usage of shade, which comes all the way down to: If it&#8217;s a shade, use it.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Will Darcy (Martin Henderson) is a wealthy younger New York motel guy, travelling India because his antique pal from London, Balraj (Naveen Andrews) is the exceptional guy at a wedding. The Bakshi circle of relatives is friendly with the own family of the bride, and Mrs. Bakshi (Nadira Babbar) hopes her four daughters can meet eligible husbands on the event. That method works without delay for Balraj and Jaya Bakshi (Namrata Shirodkar), Lalita&#8217;s older sister. For them, it is love before everything sight. For Darcy and Lalita, it&#8217;s not.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Darcy makes tactless remarks, disagrees with the custom of arranged marriages, appears caught-up, is distracted by business, and creates the possibility that Lalita might also should comply with her mother&#8217;s commands and marry the creepy Hollywood multi-millionaire Mr. Kholi (Nitin Chandra Ganatra). Things might be worse; Harvey Weinstein is likewise traveling India. We know Lalita won&#8217;t actually marry Mr. Kholi, in view that he&#8217;s never supplied with a primary name, however in testimonies of this type it&#8217;s important for Darby and Lalita to rub every other the incorrect way, so that later they are able to rub each other the right way.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>This plot, recycled from Austen, is the clothesline for a series of dance numbers that, like Hong Kong motion sequences, are set in not likely locations and use props determined there; how else to give an explanation for the series set in, sure, a Mexican eating place? Even the maximum strenuous dances are intercut with perfectly composed closeups of Aishwarya Rai, by no means sweaty, in no way quick of breath. What a smile. Did I say that?</span>
