    <span>Return to the 1970s Mumbai hidden world when smuggling was the most heinous wrongdoing (the age of innocence, huh!) and considerate wear, Sultan Mirza (reference point: Haji Mastan) was the mafioso king. The film presents the ascent and rule of Sultan over the city as a celebrated Robin Hood figure and his rough relationship with his greatest fan-turned-enemy, Shoaib Khan (reference point: Dawood Ibrahim), who joins him as a tenderfoot gangster, just to outplay him and usurp his realm. This turns into the beginning of Mumbai&#8217;s tryst with monstrous wrongdoing: gang wars, shoot-outs, bombs, dread and the huge bad bhai log as we probably are aware them today&#8230;.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: So, you&#8217;ve seen Satya and adored it. You&#8217;ve also seen Company and lapped it up as well. Had a most satisfying experience with Black Friday also. You&#8217;ve even read those page turners on Mumbai&#8217;s hidden world, Maximum City and Shantaram, and contemplated whether there&#8217;s anything all the more left to be said about the shining city&#8217;s sleazy underside. Pause your breathing. For Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai may very well take your breath away with its luminosity and engaging quality.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>

    <span>Valid, the film does re-open the familiar X-records of Mumbai&#8217;s most notable wrongdoing story &#8211; the blustery relationship between Haji Mastan and his protegee Dawood Ibrahim, despite the fact that it starts with the mandatory disclaimer of steering clear from real life. Yet, it does it with an elegance and an intensity that keeps you stuck to your seats, regardless of the fact that you know where the drama is headed for. And that&#8217;s because chief Milan Luthria decides to anchor his film in the emotional heartland rather than dabble with firearms and butchery. Refreshingly, the film goes low on viciousness and spotlights more on the emotional remainder, throwing light on how Sultan Mirza (an awesome Ajay Devgn) rose to his Shahenshah-esque status in the hidden world and how he attempted to tame the tricky new team part, Shoaib Khan (a tense Emraan Hashmi). Alas, in vain!&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>And here-in lies the dramatic center of Rajat Arora&#8217;s dynamic content which catapults the two lead characters as an investigation in contrast. While Sultan is showcased as the archetypal gentleman criminal with a solid moral fiber, Shoaib is unprincipled and no good. Like that dada, everything being equal, Vito Corleone, our desi Godfather also won&#8217;t take medications and insists he dabbles just with stuff banned by the law of the land not by his heart. Shoaib, then again, is game for any and everything &#8211; treachery, infidelity, gang war, slaughter &#8211; in his unbridled bid for power. Obviously, he begins as the believed acolyte of the man he venerates as God himself (Maine toh bhagwan chun liya hai, ab aap insaan chuniye, he tells the famous Sultan), yet it doesn&#8217;t take some time before he focuses on the more extensive skyline. Mumbai simple neeche aur main dhuey ki tarah upar (Mumbai beneath me while I scale above as smoke), he declares and roller-coasts his way on the road to unadulterated wrongdoing and total immorality, ending up as the outlaw who managed to lead the city with controller. Interestingly, regardless of presenting Sultan as a larger-than-life figure, the film figures out how to keep its moral compass straight and has a seminal grouping which categorically brands all its seemingly brave characters as criminals, charisma notwithstanding.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Interspersed between this titanic tale of a ganglord and his wannabe are the delicate romantic tales of the two escapees. Once again, finished with a delicate finesse which creates memorable mush on screen as Sultan serenades the actress Rehana (Kangna Ranaut) and Shoaib attempts a Bobby with his timid display area young lady Mumtaz (Prachi Desai).&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>After the innovative and experimental Love Sex aur Dhoka, maker Ektaa Kapoor once again scores with a total entertainer which boasts of almost everything: a compelling story, fresh and absolutely state-of-the-art dialogs (Rajat Arora), an artistic period piece ambience (Aseem Mishra), a lilting music score (Pritam) and some riveting performances. Both Ajay Devgn and Emraan Hashmi breathe hell and damnation in to their portrayal of the two disparate gangsters and think of two of the most enthralling acts of the year, while Kangna Ranaut and Prachi Desai contribute as awesome and beautiful molls. Add to this an in-structure gathering cast which includes principled cop Randeep Hooda and loyal Sultan aide, Naved Aslam (both are amazingly watchable) and you have a whole catwalk of flesh characters in a cinema that is generally inhabited with cardboard patterns.&nbsp;</span>
