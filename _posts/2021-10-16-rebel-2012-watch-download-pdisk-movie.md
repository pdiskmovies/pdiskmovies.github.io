<div>
  <span>Rishi (Prabhas) is out to get his father’s killers. But to get at them he first wishes to befriend Nandini (Tamannaah,) a ‘hip-hop dancer’ based in Bangkok. And Rishi will not stop at some thing to get his revenge.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The movie pushes the bounds of the term ‘stylized movement’. In one episode you have Prabhas (in an all black ensemble) taking walks down the street puffing on a cigarette with the baddies flying all around him and the Dolby Stereo on full blast! In the climax, you&#8217;ve got a gaggle of smoking warm ‘firang’ ladies in red commercial enterprise suits and stilettos having a cross at Prabhas, who himself is wearing a white designer in shape in addition!</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>It doesn’t live ‘slick’ and ‘elegant’ all of the manner even though. We have Prabhas pitted against 100 sari-clad men as well. Clearly director Raghava Lawrence turned into in no mood to hold lower back and he’s given it the proverbial ‘the entirety but the kitchen sink’, in no way thoughts the stink! It’s a mass movement entertainer after all.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Just if you are wondering what the entire deal is about, nicely it’s an average revenge story. The movie is about Rishi (Prabhas), an indignant younger man who is out to avenge his father’s homicide. His dad, Bhupathi (Krishnam Raju) turned into a great-natured don who wore white fits, black sun shades, had a posse of henchmen and changed into the messiah for the downtrodden of Visakhapatnam. But Bhupathi receives killed with the aid of his personal brother (Mukesh Rishi) who had his axe to grind towards him. Mukesh Rishi collaborates with Stephen, a hired murderer, to do the activity. Rishi’s female friend Deepali (Deksha), also gets killed in the bargain. Thereafter they tackle aliases and go underground.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Our guy is on their path and that leads him to Nandini, a ‘hip-hop dancer’ who lives in Bangkok. Rishi heads to Bangkok with Narasaraju (Brahmanandam) in tow.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The plan is to woo Nandini and coax out of her the whereabouts of his father’s killers. Needless to say everything goes to devise. However, you may’t say the identical approximately the film.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Clocking a color much less than 3 hours, the movie simply seems to just move on and on. The movie sticks to the formula pretty lots and has Prabhas doing the entirety his lovers would count on him to do on display. He’s even pulled out some fancy dance moves. Tamannaah is in her element gambling the horny dancer babe and glams-up the lawsuits along with her presence.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>The comedy tracks inside the first-1/2 evoke some laughs despite the fact that they do raise questions of flavor. If you are the kind who might crack up looking Kovai Sarala and Brahmanadam gyrating to hip-hop music and Ali dancing to classical song then you will enjoy it. It’s an A rated film in the end.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>There is a surfeit of difficult movement episodes however they fail to add any fee to the overall experience. The song is another big let-down. The screenplay and writing is, well, amateurish at exceptional. Looks like the components failed to come collectively this time around. There is lots of Prabhas although and we can must see whether his presence by myself can salvage this one. There could be very little else.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Tip-Off: It’s a fashionable version motion entertainer made for the ‘mass’ enthusiasts. Don’t visit the theater anticipating finesse.</span>
