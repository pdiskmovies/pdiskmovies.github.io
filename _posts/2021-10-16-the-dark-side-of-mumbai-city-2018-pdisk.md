    <span>Seven individual lives, all interlaced in manners mutiple, are gotten a handle on in the grasp of life&#8217;s inflexible hardships that at last pushes them over the fence, inciting practically every one of the characters – Anand (Nikhil Ratnaparkhi), Parul (Jyoti Malshe), Kavya (Neha Khan), Warren Lobo (Deep Raj Rana),Sumit Balsaria (Kay Menon), Zulfiqar Hussain (Mahesh Bhatt), Prince (Avii) – to capitulate to the blows of sadness.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>&#8216;The Dark Side of Life: Mumbai City&#8217; is an endeavor to depict the shadowy side of a major city like Mumbai and how, to mix in with the group and satisfy their high as can be assumptions, individuals commit irreversible errors before the acknowledgment sets in that life in a substantial wilderness isn&#8217;t just about as blushing as it appears.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The episodes displayed in this cut of-life flick, which are probably terrible and an impression of what life looks like, doesn&#8217;t resound with the crowd at all. Combined with a dull content, is some awful acting and poor cinematography. Mahesh Bhatt, who assumes the part of a pining father, is an incredible normal before the camera. Kay Menon, notwithstanding a frail story close by, renders a presentation that one would anticipate from a prepared entertainer like him. Rest of the cast was quite dull and neglected to inspire any feeling of pain or pity for the tales they are a piece of and the characters they article on screen.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>&#8216;The Dark Side of Life: Mumbai City&#8217; has numerous adversaries that kill its legitimate endeavor towards featuring the disturbing issue of wretchedness and self destruction, and its length is one of them. The repeating signature tune in the film, Aawargi, is utilized as and when satisfied, which is a major killjoy. What&#8217;s more, the treatment of the sub-plots neglect to legitimize every character&#8217;sdecision to take their lives and the ensuing shift in perspective, particularly in light of the fact that their melancholy doesn&#8217;t convert into the screen the manner in which it ought to have.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>In case you are new to Mumbai, this film is maybe a helpless alternative to go to for understanding the beat of this enthusiastic city. &#8216;The Dark Side of Life: Mumbai City&#8217; is tumultuous, erratic. The dramatization is an entirety of everything and that is the place where it turns out badly.</span>
