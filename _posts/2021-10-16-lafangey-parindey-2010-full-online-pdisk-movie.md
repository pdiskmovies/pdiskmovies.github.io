    <span>Pinky Palkar (Deepika Padukone) is the model Mumbai chawl young lady who thinks beyond practical boundaries, notwithstanding her humble environmental factors. She might be functioning as a shop right hand yet she is never going to budge on ascending the social stepping stool with her skating abilities which she proposes to feature in a TV ability show, wanting to win the Rs 50 lakh grant in the opposition. However, her best laid plans turn out badly when fighter hoodlum, One-Shot Nandu (Neil Nitin Mukesh) hits her head-first with his vehicle and makes her go visually impaired. The rest is contrition, regret and sentiment, where Nandu attempts to train his casualty to see with her heart, while Pinky desires to draw the tapori away from his brutal world.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: It&#8217;s a natural universe of bhais, fighters and bustee wallahs which Mumbai film has made and re-made, consistently that gazes at you in Lafangey Parindey. Also, it&#8217;s this commonality of character and content that really neutralizes Pradeep Sarkar&#8217;s third romantic tale which comes after Parineeta and Laaga Chunari Mein Daag. There is an abrogating feeling of history repeating itself that conquers you as you watch the platitude ridden script unfurl in an anticipated style, where the harsh edged hoodlum is drawn towards his sweet yet solid casualty. But, it isn&#8217;t not difficult to discount the film totally.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>So what works in support of its? For the most part, it&#8217;s the exhibitions that lift the film from the unremarkableness of its content. Neil Nitin Mukesh has effectively demonstrated his specialty at playing restless characters in films like Johnny Gaddaar and New York. Indeed, he deciphers One-Shot Nandu, the blindfold fighter who fells his rival with a solitary shot and works for criminal Usman Ali (Piyush Mishra), with trademark spirit. Never insane and reasonably controlled, Neil&#8217;s Nandu is the lethargic spring of gushing lava somewhat tapori who might be a powerful warrior however frantically battles short, everything being equal. Deepika Padukone&#8217;s Pinky also figures out how to contact your heart with her brilliant desires and her crude mental fortitude, in spite of the fact that Deepika pitches the passionate remainder to some degree low trying to make a reasonable Maharashtrian mulgi, in contrast to Priyanka Chopra&#8217;s Sweety, the alarm in Kaminey. Together, the pair figure out how to make a sweet romantic tale for certain surprising experiences like watching a film together, figuring out how to skate-dance together, getting moony on a train top.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Similarly capturing is the famously watchable Piyush Mishra who consistently figures out how to add a deranged enthusiasm to his depictions. Tragically, his person stays some what lacking in the film and the watcher winds up wishing he had more to do.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Add to this, an expressive music score by R Anandh, with lilting numbers like Man Lafanga and Nain Parindey and some astonishing movement on rollerskates by Bosco-Caesar, and you have a film that compensates for lovely survey. Somewhat more verve anyway would have gone far in empowering the show.</span>
