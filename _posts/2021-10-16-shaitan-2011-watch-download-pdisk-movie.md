  <span>Amy (Kalki Koechlin) leaves LA for Mumbai whilst her NRI dad (Rajit Kapoor) comes to a decision to relocate. Nothing incorrect with that except that Amy&#8217;s had a disturbed early life and has grown up into a disturbed teen herself. What&#8217;s extra, she joins a collection of wealthy, reckless and aimless young human beings in Mumbai who&#8217;re hell-bent on residing lifestyles on the brink. Drugs, speedy automobiles and the perpetual look for a high lead Amy and her buddies right into a seething cauldron of crime and violence.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Movie Review: Is there a road again from hell? Does the spiral of violence spin relentlessly in a single route simplest: toward doom? Is there desire for the reckless and rootless young humans who have all their dad&#8217;s money to splurge and no motive of lifestyles to pursue?</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Shaitaan is not your run-of-the-mill Bollywood kids movie that looks at lifestyles through rose-tinted prisms. On the opposite, it turns the digital camera three-sixty ranges and brings you the dust of a subterranean sub-way of life that throbs amidst a sure phase of metropolitan maverick twenty-somethings.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Amy and her buddies even as away their long and listless hours indulging in the traditional hobbies. They do pills, take weird risks, conduct petty heists and race cars&#8230;. Until one such race results in an accident. That&#8217;s the start of their descent right into a vicious circle of crime and violence, in which, as a way to store themselves they may be inclined to position the whole lot at the lower back burner, in particular sanity and morality. And the reality that most of them do it with nonchalance strikes a chilling word.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span>Say whats up to the desi Mickey and Mallory, Oliver Stone&#8217;s Natural Born Killers. Shaitaan&#8217;s gang of no-gooders can be a disturbing lot, however they are immensely watchable as they stroll the tightrope among sanity and madness. The whole ensemble forged performs nicely of their respective roles. Rajeev Khandelwal, the cop who doggedly chases them to their nemesis, proves once more (after Aamir) that he has extremely good big screen presence too. But Shaitaan basically belongs to debutant director Bijoy Nambiar who takes time to heat up, and once he does, there&#8217;s no stopping him. Watch out for one scene mainly: the shoot-out on the grungy hotel performed out in opposition to a brand new age rendition of the classic Khoya Khoya Chand. Gives you your money&#8217;s worth.</span>
