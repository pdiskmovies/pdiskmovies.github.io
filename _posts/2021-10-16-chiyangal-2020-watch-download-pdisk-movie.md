    <span>Chiyangal Review: Set against the background of a town in Theni, Chiyangal is about the story of seven naughty senior residents who are dear companions. They make every second count, unaware of how society makes a decision about them. However a couple of them are frustrated with the manner in which their kids treat them, they guarantee to enjoy little things which welcome a grin on their appearances. As days cruised by, two of their choices to end their lives because of abuse at home leave others crushed. They choose to make every one of their aspirations materialize, and begin chipping away at it. Them five go to Chennai to acknowledge one they had always wanted to fly in a plane. However, an appalling occurrence plays spoilsport to their arrangements.&nbsp;</span>

    <span>The great fascination of the film is the depiction of kinship among the senior residents, played by Nalinikanth, Pasupathyraj, Eashwar Thiyagarajan, Durai Sundharam, Samuthiraseeni, Sakthivel and Narayanasamy. Their battles, little joys, torment of enthusiastic disregard and different sentiments are portrayed engagingly that watchers can identify with them. A portion of the person artistes, similar to the ones who played Nalinikanth&#8217;s significant other and girl, as well, set up a persuading execution.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>The specialized divisions are okayish, while the heartfelt track of the male and female lead, tried by Karikalan and Risha Haridas, crashes and burns. The film has its minutes, on account of a portion of the adequately made impactful successions. However, as the film creeps towards its peak, a portion of the scenes become exaggerated and the exchanges about securing guardians, however pertinent, seem long winded.</span>
