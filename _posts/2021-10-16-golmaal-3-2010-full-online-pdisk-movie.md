    <span>The clowns of the Golmaal series get back to set the screen ablaze with their insane tricks. This time, their numbers have expanded. There are Ma&#8217;s (Ratna Pathak Shah) young men headed by a hot-headed Ajay Devgn with a unique Kareena as an awesome extra and there are Pa&#8217;s (Mithun Chakraborty) young men, driven by flippant Arshad Warsi and discourse wonder Tusshar Kapoor. The fighting imps are compelled to live under one rooftop when their temporary parents choose to wed in middle age. Can the competitions be forgotten for the cheerful family condition?&nbsp;</span>

    <span>Film Review: In an industry where spin-offs infrequently work, the Golmaal establishment appears to have hit gold with its recipe of seeming well and good out of garbage. On the off chance that Golmaal-l was sheer fun, the second in the series took a slight plunge as far as joy. Fortunately, Golmaal 3 fixes the chart by firing up the chuckling meter and giving an ideal Diwali escape to watchers who are ravenous for some hungama this happy season.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>Obviously, it&#8217;s an easy decision satire and isn&#8217;t intended for individuals who favor astuteness in mind as well. Furthermore, just the stupid would go chasing for an importance in the foolish jokes that detonate on the screen as the troupe cast perseveringly saves the high temple for droll.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Yet, nobody&#8217;s whining. Since Ajay Devgn&#8217;s irate blasts, Tusshar Kapoor&#8217;s verbal jokes, Arshad Warsi&#8217;s rougish celebration, Sanjay Mishra&#8217;s great mis-spellings&#8230;are all rib-stimulating stuff. Furthermore, giving an ideal setting to this shameless presentation of testosterone and brattish silliness are the senior residents: Mithun and Ratna Pathak Shah who play the heartfelt couple in &#8217;70s style. Mithun in a real sense reproduces his Disco Dancer chutzpah by romancing an Alice-band brandishing Ratna Pathak Shah with his unique dance steps. Yet, the person who&#8217;s clearly having a great time among the band of young men is Kareena Kapoor as Dabboo, the vagrant who is dead set on making the Hum Saath Hain glad family out of the fighting groups. Kareena&#8217;s dynamic, lively and ekdum bindaas, practically in a state of harmony with the unbelievable range of shadings that Rohit Shetty utilizes for the sets and ensembles of his film. You can&#8217;t be tragic, forlorn or grim get-togethers shading impact &#8211; red, yellow, orange, pink, purple &#8211; that hits you in this preposterous film.&nbsp;</span>

  <div>
    <span>The film should be pruned in places, uniquely since the comic demonstrations get dreary. However, all around, there&#8217;s a snicker revolt hanging tight for you at the multiplex, this end of the week. Have a great time.</span>
