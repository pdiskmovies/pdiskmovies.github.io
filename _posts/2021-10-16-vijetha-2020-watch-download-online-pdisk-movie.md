    <span>Srinivasa Rao (Murli Sharma) gives a valiant effort to give his youngsters all that they look for and satisfy even the littlest of their cravings. His child Ram (Kalyaan Dhev) grows up careless in regards to every one of the penances his dad needed to make to give him the existence he has. Will he at any point change and will his dad at any point track down the opportunity to satisfy his own fantasies shapes the story.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Audit: Naming Rakesh Sashi&#8217;s executive and Kalyaan Dhev&#8217;s introduction film &#8216;Vijetha&#8217; was a brave continue on the producers, taking a gander at the sort of assumptions that accompanied it. Kalyaan&#8217;s dad in-law Chiranjeevi&#8217;s 1985 film Vijetha was the tale of a football player who makes an uncommon stride for his family&#8217;s satisfaction. While no kidneys are sold here, as in the 1985 film, this is as yet the tale of a man who needs to make enormous penances for his family. But, this isn&#8217;t Ram&#8217;s (Kalyaan Dhev) story, this story has a place with his dad.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Slam is a joyful man who has a random existence. His dad Srinivasa Rao has done everything in this ability to engage him to settle on decisions he needs throughout everyday life and to settle down in a task accomplishing something he cherishes. However Ram grows up to be a flighty person who trusts in tricking ambulances and following his neighbor Chaitra (Malavika Nair) for the sake of affection as opposed to accomplishing something useful with his time. That is, until his decisions return to haunt him in the back and all that platitude jazz.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>While the account of Kalyaan Dhev&#8217;s person can possibly be a relatable transitioning track, it neglects to connect generally because of the entertainer&#8217;s failure to act out. His eyes simply decline to show any feeling, remaining creepily clear even in the most (probably) nostalgic scenes. It&#8217;s a secret to anybody why Malavika Nair exists in this film, since she (fortunately) has no two part harmonies to sing with the lead entertainer all things considered. Their adoration track never gets gotten nor is any evident kinship at any point created between the characters in any case. No science to search for here!&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Who sparkles in the film, in spite of the laggy screenplay and unpredictable storyline, is Murli Sharma. He acts out delightfully, conveying an unpretentious and terrific presentation. In spite of the majority of the film committed to Ram and his companion&#8217;s jokes, with an endeavor to make burnt out satire in the film, Srinivasa Rao&#8217;s track seems like the most fascinating piece of the film. His is a person a great many people will associate as well, helping them to remember their folks.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Sadly, the producer chooses to zero in rather on superfluous nostalgic or funny scenes that neglect to summon anything in the crowd. He additionally is by all accounts attempting to make a point about youngsters recognizing the penances guardians make for their joy, yet the message is sadly lost in the befuddled manner the film goes about it. A grasping, unobtrusive and relatable screenplay is the thing that the film required and needed significantly.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Aside from Murli Sharma, the music of the film created by debutant Harshavardhan Rameshwar is an enjoyment as well. Regardless of the storyline lacking newness, it could&#8217;ve been a connecting with ride if by some stroke of good luck Rakesh had taken the less-trampled way and picked Srinivasa Rao to be the focal point of the story rather than Ram. All things considered, he is the genuine Vijetha of the film!</span>
