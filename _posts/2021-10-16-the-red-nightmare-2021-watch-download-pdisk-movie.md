    <span>We’ve reviewed numerous of Alexander Henderson’s shorts within the beyond, maximum lately Trap. We’ve additionally reviewed several episodes of his internet series Safer-At-Home and his characteristic Sacren. The man positive remains busy, and now he’s accrued thirteen of those shorts collectively for an anthology, The Red Nightmare.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Apart from Trap, I’ve reviewed two other shorts in The Red Nightmare, The Lady and Santa so I received’t hassle rehashing them right here. But if you want a brief version, I preferred all 3 of them.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Right from the begin, some of the segments are variations on a similar subject. Ghosts and evil spirits stalking quality current flats in preference to old dark houses. The starting phase, “Momo” (now not to be burdened with Momo: The Missouri Monster), is primarily based on the net hoax from more than one years in the past. Lola (Nicoletta Hanssen, Flesh and Blood a Go! Go!) and Donnie (Wade Baker, Division 19, Airliner Sky Battle) awaken to find the titular creature (Aza Sharavnyam) in their condo. Nicoletta Hanssen will flip up later in a comparable segment “Shedim” in which she has to cope with one of the shadow human beings.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>“The Smiling Woman” is a moderate reversal of the subject by having a person be the recipient of the creature’s attention. An artist, Steven (Reid Schmidt, Ugly Sweater Party), is terrorized through a person out of his beyond (DJ Dallenbach) who takes at the form of his maximum recent drawing. While nevertheless powerful, at fifteen minutes this one feels a bit lengthy, coming after after two comparable segments. Also, if I got a name from someone relating to themselves as “The mother of your abortion” I doubt my reaction could be “I’ll depart the door unlocked.”</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>And that is the main trouble I had with The Red Nightmare. The segments are, in and of themselves commonly quite exact. There’s enough variant between those with similar subject matters to make them enjoyable to observe individually. But seeing them returned to back they begin to sense repetitive. They have to had been scattered via the collection rather.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>It additionally makes the segments where Henderson steps far from that formula stand out extra. For instance “Chrissy” wherein a model (Marine Madesclaire) has to address a relatively creepy photographer (Reid Schmidt). The supernatural twist is the least demanding factor approximately this quick.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Also of observe is “Mystery Box” in which a lady (Rosa Pérez) gets a package containing what looks like a snuff movie. It’s pretty brief, however with a very last twist I didn’t foresee.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>“Airbnb” ends The Red Nightmare with a tale of all to human evil. Dan Garland (A Dark Foe) gives a pleasing Anthony Perkins style performance as Gregory. But I couldn’t figure out why in preference to truely hide. Jacob (Evan Benham, The Grotesque World of Jimmy the Bean) didn’t clutch some thing to combat back with.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>Taken in my view, the shorts range from awesome to, at the worst, watchable. There’s no doubt Henderson can direct an excellent brief film. My troubles with The Red Nightmare are the way the collection is provided. There’s no wraparound segment so the segments just follow every different with a title card between them. Some have credits on the start a few don’t, which makes the collection sense even more disjointed. There are complete credits for all the films at the quit of The Red Nightmare.&nbsp;</span><span>Also undergo in mind that the segments, while now not exactly own family pleasant, are YouTube safe. Those searching out greater graphic fare may be disillusioned.&nbsp;</span><span>The Red Nightmare is free to look at on the director’s YouTube channel, as are numerous of the shorts in my opinion in addition to a few other shorts not in the collection. I’m giving the film 3 stars though the shorts could likely are becoming 4 with a better framework.</span>
